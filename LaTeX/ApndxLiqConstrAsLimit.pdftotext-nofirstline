Solution as a Limit
Formally, suppose we change the description of the problem by making the following
two assumptions:
℘ =0
ct ≤ mt ,
and we designate the solution to this consumer’s problem c̀t (m). We will henceforth refer
to this as the problem of the ‘restrained’ consumer (and, to avoid a common confusion,
we will refer to the consumer as ‘constrained’ only in circumstances when the constraint
is actually binding).
Redesignate the consumption function that emerges from our original problem for a
given fixed ℘ as ct (m; ℘) where we separate the arguments by a semicolon to distinguish
between m, which is a state variable, and ℘, which is not. The proposition we wish to
demonstrate is
lim ct (m; ℘) = c̀t (m).

We will first examine the problem in period T − 1, then argue that the desired result
propagates to earlier periods. For simplicity, suppose that the interest, growth, and
time-preference factors are β = R = Γ = 1, and there are no permanent shocks, ψ = 1;
the results below are easily generalized to the full-fledged version of the problem.
The solution to the restrained consumer’s optimization problem can be obtained as
follows. Assuming that the consumer’s behavior in period T is given by cT (m) (in
practice, this will be cT (m) = m), consider the unrestrained optimization problem

As usual, the envelope theorem tells us that vT0 (m) = u0 (cT (m)) so the expected
marginal value of ending period T − 1 with assets a can be defined as

v̀T −1 (a) ≡

and the solution to (2) will satisfy
u0 (m − a) = v̀0T −1 (a).

à∗T −1 (m) therefore answers the question “With what level of assets would the restrained
consumer like to end period T − 1 if the constraint cT −1 ≤ mT −1 did not exist?” (Note
that the restrained consumer’s income process remains different from the process for
the unrestrained consumer so long as ℘ > 0.) The restrained consumer’s actual asset
position will be
àT −1 (m) = max[0, à∗T −1 (m)],

reflecting the inability of the restrained consumer to spend more than current resources,
and note (as pointed out by Deaton (1991)) that
−1/ρ
m1# = v̀0T −1 (0)
is the cusp value of m at which the constraint makes the transition between binding and
non-binding in period T − 1.
Analogously to (3), defining

the Euler equation for the original consumer’s problem implies
(m − a)−ρ = v0T −1 (a; ℘)

with solution a∗T −1 (m; ℘). Now note that for any fixed a > 0, lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a).
Since the LHS of (3) and (5) are identical, this means that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) = à∗T −1 (m).
That is, for any fixed value of m > m1# such that the consumer subject to the restraint
would voluntarily choose to end the period with positive assets, the level of end-of-period
assets for the unrestrained consumer approaches the level for the restrained consumer
as ℘ ↓ 0. With the same a and the same m, the consumers must have the same c, so the
consumption functions are identical in the limit.
Now consider values m ≤ m1# for which the restrained consumer is constrained. It
is obvious that the baseline consumer will never choose a ≤ 0 because the first term
in (4) is lima↓0 ℘a−ρ = ∞, while lima↓0 (m − a)−ρ is finite (the marginal value of endof-period assets approaches infinity as assets approach zero, but the marginal utility of
consumption has a finite limit for m > 0). The subtler question is whether it is possible
to rule out strictly positive a for the unrestrained consumer.
The answer is yes. Suppose, for some m < m1# , that the unrestrained consumer is
considering ending the period with any positive amount of assets a = δ > 0. For any such
δ we have that lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a). But by assumption we are considering a set
of circumstances in which à∗T −1 (m) < 0, and we showed earlier that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) =
à∗T −1 (m). So, having assumed a = δ > 0, we have proven that the consumer would
optimally choose a < 0, which is a contradiction. A similar argument holds for m = m1# .
These arguments demonstrate that for any m > 0, lim℘↓0 cT −1 (m; ℘) = c̀T −1 (m) which
is the period T − 1 version of (1). But given equality of the period T − 1 consumption
functions, backwards recursion of the same arguments demonstrates that the limiting
consumption functions in previous periods are also identical to the constrained function.
Note finally that another intuitive confirmation of the equivalence between the two
problems is that our formula (98) for the maximal marginal propensity to consume
satisfies
lim κ̄ = 1,
℘↓0

which makes sense because the marginal propensity to consume for a constrained restrained consumer is 1 by our definitions of ‘constrained’ and ‘restrained.’

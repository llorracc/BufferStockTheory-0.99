A Perfect Foresight Liquidity Constrained Solution
Under perfect foresight in the presence of a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0, this
appendix taxonomizes the varieties of the limiting consumption function c̀(m) that arise
under various parametric conditions. Results are summarized in table 1.

A.1 If PF-GIC Fails
A consumer is ‘growth patient’ if the perfect foresight growth impatience condition
(

fails ((
PF-GIC,
1 < Þ /Γ). Under (
PF-GIC
the constraint does not bind at the lowest
feasible value of mt = 1 because 1 < (Rβ)1/ρ /Γ implies that spending everything today
(setting ct = mt = 1) produces lower marginal utility than is obtainable by reallocating
a marginal unit of resources to the next period at return R:1
1 < (Rβ)1/ρ Γ−1
1 < RβΓ−ρ
u0 (1) < Rβu0 (Γ).

(1)

Similar logic shows that under these circumstances the constraint will never bind at
m = 1 for a constrained consumer with a finite horizon of n periods, so for m ≥ 1
such a consumer’s consumption function will be the same as for the unconstrained case
examined in the main text.
If the RIC fails (1 < Þ R ) while the finite human wealth condition holds, the limiting
value of this consumption function as n ↑ ∞ is the degenerate function
c̀T −n (m) = 0(bt + h).

(2)

(that is, consumption is zero for any level of human or nonhuman wealth).
If the RIC fails and the FHWC fails, human wealth limits to h = ∞ so the consumption
function limits to either c̀T −n (m) = 0 or c̀T −n (m) = ∞ depending on the relative speeds
with which the MPC approaches zero and human wealth approaches ∞.2
Thus, the requirement that the consumption function be nondegenerate implies that
(

PF-GIC
we must impose the RIC (and the FHWC can be
for a consumer satisfying (
(

PF-GIC
and RIC). In this case, the consumer’s optimal
shown to be a consequence of (
behavior is easy to describe. We can calculate the point at which the unconstrained
consumer would choose c = m from equation (21):
m# = (m# − 1 + h)κ
1

(3)

The point at which the constraint would bind (if that point could be attained) is the m = c for
which u0 (c# ) = Rβu0 (Γ) which is c# = Γ/(Rβ)1/ρ and the consumption function will be defined by
c̀(m) = min[m, c# + (m − c# )κ].
2
The knife-edge case is where Þ = Γ, in which case the two quantites counterbalance and the
limiting function is c̀(m) = min[m, 1].

which (under these assumptions) satisfies 0 < m# < 1.3 For m < m# the unconstrained
consumer would choose to consume more than m; for such m, the constrained consumer
is obliged to choose c̀(m) = m.4 For any m > m# the constraint will never bind and the
consumer will choose to spend the same amount as the unconstrained consumer, c̄(m).
(Stachurski and Toda (2019) obtain a similar lower bound on consumption and use it
to study the tail behavior of the wealth distribution.)

A.2 If PF-GIC Holds
Imposition of the PF-GIC reverses the inequality in (1), and thus reverses the conclusion:
A consumer who starts with mt = 1 will desire to consume more than 1. Such a consumer
will be constrained, not only in period t, but perpetually thereafter.
Now define bn# as the bt such that an unconstrained consumer holding bt = bn# would
behave so as to arrive in period t + n with bt+n = 0 (with b0# trivially equal to 0); for
example, a consumer with bt−1 = b1# was on the ‘cusp’ of being constrained in period t−1:
Had bt−1 been infinitesimally smaller, the constraint would have been binding (because
the consumer would have desired, but been unable, to enter period t with negative, not
zero, b). Given the PF-GIC, the constraint certainly binds in period t (and thereafter)
with resources of mt = m0# = 1 + b0# = 1: The consumer cannot spend more (because
constrained), and will not choose to spend less (because impatient), than ct = c0# = 1.
We can construct the entire ‘prehistory’ of this consumer leading up to t as follows.
Maintaining the assumption that the constraint has never bound in the past, c must
have been growing according to Þ Γ , so consumption n periods in the past must have
been

Note that 0 < m# is implied by RIC and m# < 1 is implied by (

As an illustration, consider a consumer for whom Þ = 1, R = 1.01 and Γ = 0.99. This consumer will
save the amount necessary to ensure that growth in market wealth exactly offsets the decline in human
wealth represented by Γ < 1; total wealth (and therefore total consumption) will remain constant, even
as market wealth and human wealth trend in opposite directions.

and note that the consumer’s human wealth between t − n and t (the relevant time
horizon, because from t onward the consumer will be constrained and unable to access
post-t income) is
hn# = 1 + ... + R−n

(9)

while the intertemporal budget constraint says
Ctt−n = bn# + hn#
from which we can solve for the bn# such that the consumer with bt−n = bn# would
unconstrainedly plan (in period t − n) to arrive in period t with bt = 0:

Defining mn# = bn# + 1, consider the function c̀(m) defined by linearly connecting the
points {mn# , cn# } for integer values of n ≥ 0 (and setting c̀(m) = m for m < 1). This
function will return, for any value of m, the optimal value of c for a liquidity constrained
consumer with an infinite horizon. The function is piecewise linear with ‘kink points’
where the slope discretely changes; for infinitesimal  the MPC of a consumer with assets
m = mn# −  is discretely higher than for a consumer with assets m = mn# +  because
the latter consumer will spread a marginal dollar over more periods before exhausting
it.
In order for a unique consumption function to be defined by this sequence (10) for the
entire domain of positive real values of b, we need bn# to become arbitrarily large with
n. That is, we need
lim bn# = ∞.

A.2.1 If FHWC Holds
The FHWC requires R−1 < 1, in which case the second term in (10) limits to a constant

Given the PF-GIC Þ −1
Γ > 1, this will hold iff the RIC holds, Þ R < 1. But given that
the FHWC R > Γ holds, the PF-GIC is stronger (harder to satisfy) than the RIC; thus,
the FHWC and the PF-GIC together imply the RIC, and so a well-defined solution exists.
Furthermore, in the limit as n approaches infinity, the difference between the limiting
constrained consumption function and the unconstrained consumption function becomes

3

vanishingly small, because the date at which the constraint binds becomes arbitrarily
distant, so the effect of that constraint on current behavior shrinks to nothing. That is,
lim c̀(m) − c̄(m) = 0.

but that limit is approached gradually, starting from a positive value, and consequently
the consumption function is not the degenerate c̀(m) = 0. (Figure 1 presents an example
for ρ = 2, R = 0.98, β = 1.00, Γ = 0.99; note that the horizontal axis is bank balances
b = m−1; the part of the consumption function below the depicted points is uninteresting
– c = m – so not worth plotting).
We can summarize as follows. Given that the PF-GIC holds, the interesting question is
whether the FHWC holds. If so, the RIC automatically holds, and the solution limits into
the solution to the unconstrained problem as m ↑ ∞. But even if the FHWC fails, the
problem has a well-defined and nondegenerate solution, whether or not the RIC holds.
Although these results were derived for the perfect foresight case, we know from work
elsewhere in this paper and in other places that the perfect foresight case is an upper
bound for the case with uncertainty. If the upper bound of the MPC in the perfect
foresight case is zero, it is not possible for the upper bound in the model with uncertainty
to be greater than zero, because for any κ > 0 the level of consumption in the model
with uncertainty would eventually exceed the level of consumption in the absence of
uncertainty.

allows for non-CRRA utility as well as capital and labor income risks in a Markovian
setting, and find that in that much more general framework the limiting MPC is also
zero.

B Existence of a Concave Consumption Function
To show that (6) defines a sequence of continuously differentiable strictly increasing
concave functions {cT , cT −1 , ..., cT −k }, we start with a definition. We will say that a
function n(z) is ‘nice’ if it satisfies
1. n(z) is well-defined iff z > 0
2. n(z) is strictly increasing
3. n(z) is strictly concave
4. n(z) is C3
5. n(z) < 0
6. limz↓0 n(z) = −∞.
(Notice that an implication of niceness is that limz↓0 n0 (z) = ∞.)
Assume that some vt+1 is nice. Our objective is to show that this implies vt is also
nice; this is sufficient to establish that vt−n is nice by induction for all n > 0 because
vT (m) = u(m) and u(m) = m1−ρ /(1 − ρ) is nice by inspection.
Now define an end-of-period value function vt (a) as

 1−ρ
vt (a) = β Et Γt+1
vt+1 (Rt+1 a + ξt+1 ) .
(20)

6

Since there is a positive probability that ξt+1 will attain its minimum of zero and since
Rt+1 > 0, it is clear that lima↓0 vt (a) = −∞ and lima↓0 v0t (a) = ∞. So vt (a) is welldefined iff a > 0; it is similarly straightforward to show the other properties required for
vt (a) to be nice. (See Hiraguchi (2003).)
Next define vt (m, c) as
vt (m, c) = u(c) + vt (m − c)

(21)

which is C3 since vt and u are both C3 , and note that our problem’s value function
defined in (6) can be written as
vt (m) = max vt (m, c).

(22)

c

vt is well-defined if and only if 0 < c < m. Furthermore, limc↓0 vt (m, c) =
∂ 2 vt (m,c)
∂v (m,c)
∂v (m,c)
limc↑m vt (m, c) = −∞, ∂c
< 0, limc↓0 t∂c = +∞, and limc↑m t∂c = −∞. It
2
follows that the ct (m) defined by
ct (m) = arg max vt (m, c)

(23)

0<c<m

exists and is unique, and (6) has an internal solution that satisfies
u0 (ct (m)) = v0t (m − ct (m)).

(24)

Since both u and vt are strictly concave, both ct (m) and at (m) = m−ct (m) are strictly
increasing. Since both u and vt are three times continuously differentiable, using (24)
we can conclude that ct (m) is continuously differentiable and
c0t (m) =

v00t (at (m))
.
u00 (ct (m)) + v00t (at (m))

(25)

Similarly we can easily show that ct (m) is twice continuously differentiable (as is at (m))
(See Appendix C.) This implies that vt (m) is nice, since vt (m) = u(ct (m)) + vt (at (m)).

C ct(m) is Twice Continuously Differentiable
First we show that ct (m) is C1 . Define y as y ≡ m + dm. Since u0 (ct (y)) − u0 (ct (m)) =
t (m)
t (m)
v0t (at (y)) − v0t (at (m)) and at (y)−a

Since ct and at are continuous and increasing,

This implies that the right-derivative, c0+

0
Similarly we can show that c0+
t (m) = ct (m), which means ct (m) exists. Since vt is
C3 , c0t (m) exists and is continuous. c0t (m) is differentiable because v00t is C1 , ct (m) is C1
and u00 (ct (m)) + v00t (at (m)) < 0. c00t (m) is given by

c00t (m) =

.
[u00 (ct ) + v00t (at )]2

(26)

Since v00t (at (m)) is continuous, c00t (m) is also continuous.

D Proof that T Is a Contraction Mapping
We must show that our operator T satisfies all of Boyd’s conditions.
Boyd’s operator T maps from Cz (A, B) to C(A, B). A preliminary requirement is
therefore that {Tz} be continuous for any z−bounded z, {Tz} ∈ C(R++ , R). This is
not difficult to show; see Hiraguchi (2003).
Consider condition (1). For this problem,

so x(•) ≤ y(•) implies {Tx}(mt ) ≤ {Ty}(mt ) by inspection.7
Condition (2) requires that {T0} ∈ Cz (A, B). By definition,

z-bounded. We use the bounding function
z(m) = η + m1−ρ ,

(27)

for some real scalar η > 0 whose value will be determined in the course of the proof.
Under this definition of z, {T0}(mt ) = u(κ̄mt ) is clearly z-bounded.
Finally, we turn to condition (3), {T(z + ζz)}(mt ) ≤ {Tz}(mt ) + ζαz(mt ). The proof

will be more compact if we define c̆ and ă as the consumption and assets functions8
associated with Tz and ĉ and â as the functions associated with T(z + ζz); using this
notation, condition (3) can be rewritten
u(ĉ) + β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ u(c̆) + β{Ez}(ă) + ζαz.
Now note that if we force the ^ consumer to consume the amount that is optimal for
the ∧ consumer, value for the ^ consumer must decline (at least weakly). That is,
u(ĉ) + β{Ez}(â) ≤ u(c̆) + β{Ez}(ă).
Thus, condition (3) will certainly hold under the stronger condition
u(ĉ) + β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ u(ĉ) + β{Ez}(â) + ζαz
β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ β{Ez}(â) + ζαz
βζ{Ez}(â) ≤ ζαz
β{Ez}(â) ≤ αz
β{Ez}(â) < z.

Section 2.7 proves existence of a continuously differentiable consumption function, which implies
the existence of a corresponding continuously differentiable assets function.

The proof that T defines a contraction mapping under the conditions (37) and (33) is
now complete.
η>η=

D.1 T and v
In defining our operator T we made the restriction κmt ≤ ct ≤ κ̄mt . However, in the
discussion of the consumption function bounds, we showed only (in (38)) that κt mt ≤
ct (mt ) ≤ κ̄t mt . (The difference is in the presence or absence of time subscripts on the
MPC’s.) We have therefore not proven (yet) that the sequence of value functions (6)
defines a contraction mapping.
Fortunately, the proof of that proposition is identical to the proof above, except that
we must replace κ̄ with κ̄T −1 and the WRIC must be replaced by a slightly stronger
(but still quite weak) condition. The place where these conditions have force is in the
step at (29). Consideration of the prior two equations reveals that a sufficient stronger
condition is
℘β(R(1 − κ̄T −1 ))1−ρ < 1
(℘β)1/(1−ρ) (1 − κ̄T −1 ) > 1
(℘β)1/(1−ρ) (1 − (1 + ℘1/ρÞ R )−1 ) > 1

where we have used (36) for κ̄T −1 (and in the second step the reversal of the inequality
occurs because we have assumed ρ > 1 so that we are exponentiating both sides by the
negative number 1 − ρ). To see that this is a weak condition, note that for small values
of ℘ this expression can be further simplified using (1 + ℘1/ρÞ R )−1 ≈ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R so that
it becomes
(℘β)1/(1−ρ) ℘1/ρÞR > 1
(℘β)℘(1−ρ)/ρÞ R1−ρ < 1

β℘1/ρÞ R1−ρ < 1.

Calling the weak return patience factor Þ℘R = ℘1/ρÞR and recalling that the WRIC was
Þ−ρ
Þ ℘R < 1, the expression on the LHS above is βÞ
R times the WRPF. Since we usually
assume β not far below 1 and parameter values such that Þ R ≈ 1, this condition is
clearly not very different from the WRIC.
The upshot is that under these slightly stronger conditions the value functions for
the original problem define a contraction mapping with a unique v(m). But since
limn→∞ κT −n = κ and limn→∞ κ̄T −n = κ̄, it must be the case that the v(m) toward which
these vT −n ’s are converging is the same v(m) that was the endpoint of the contraction
defined by our operator T. Thus, under our slightly stronger (but still quite weak)

10

conditions, not only do the value functions defined by (6) converge, they converge to the
same unique v defined by T.10

D.2 Convergence of vt in Euclidian Space
Boyd’s theorem shows that T defines a contraction mapping in a z-bounded space. We
now show that T also defines a contraction mapping in Euclidian space.
Calling v∗ the unique fixed point of the operator T, since v∗ (m) = Tv∗ (m),
kvT −n+1 − v∗ kz ≤ αn−1 kvT − v∗ kz .

(31)

On the other hand, vT − v∗ ∈ Cz (A, B) and κ = kvT − v∗ kz < ∞ because vT and v∗
are in Cz (A, B). It follows that
|vT −n+1 (m) − v∗ (m)| ≤ καn−1 |z(m)| .

(32)

lim vT −n+1 (m) = v∗ (m).

(33)

Then we obtain
n→∞
1−ρ

1−ρ

Since vT (m) = m1−ρ , vT −1 (m) ≤ (κ̄m)
< vT (m). On the other hand, vT −1 ≤
1−ρ
vT means TvT −1 ≤ TvT , in other words, vT −2 (m) ≤ vT −1 (m). Inductively one gets
vT −n (m) ≥ vT −n−1 (m). This means that {vT −n+1 (m)}∞
n=1 is a decreasing sequence,
bounded below by v∗ .

D.3 Convergence of ct
Given the proof that the value functions converge, we now show the pointwise conver∞
gence of consumption functions {cT −n+1 (m)}
 n=1 .
Consider any convergent subsequence cT −n(i) (m) of {cT −n+1 (m)}∞
n=1 converging to
c∗ . By the definition of cT −n (m), we have
1−ρ
u(cT −n(i) (m))+β ET −n(i) [Γ1−ρ
T −n(i)+1 vT −n(i)+1 (m)] ≥ u(cT −n(i) )+β ET −n(i) [ΓT −n(i)+1 vT −n(i)+1 (m)],
(34)
for any cT −n(i) ∈ [κm, κ̄m]. Now letting n(i) go to infinity, it follows that the left
hand side converges to u(c∗ ) + β Et [Γ1−ρ
v(m)], and the right hand side converges to
t
1−ρ
u(cT −n(i) ) + β Et [Γt v(m)]. So the limit of the preceding inequality as n(i) approaches

Hence, c∗ ∈

t+1 v(m)] . By the uniqueness of c(m),

cT −n(i) ∈[κm,κ̄m]
∗

c = c(m).

10

It seems likely that convergence of the value functions for the original problem could be proven
even if only the WRIC were imposed; but that proof is not an essential part of the enterprise of this
paper and is therefore left for future work.

E Equality of Aggregate Consumption Growth and
Income Growth with Transitory Shocks
Section 4.2 asserted that in the absence of permanent shocks it is possible to prove that
the growth factor for aggregate consumption approaches that for aggregate permanent
income. This section establishes that result.
First define a(m) as the function that yields optimal end-of-period assets as a function
of m.
Suppose the population starts in period t with an arbitrary value for covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i ).
Then if m̆ is the invariant mean level of m we can define a ‘mean MPS away from m̆’
function :
Z m̆+∆
¯á(∆) = ∆−1
a0 (z)dz

where the combination of the bar and the´are meant to signify that this is the average
value of the derivative over the interval. Since ψt+1,i = 1, Rt+1,i is a constant at R, if
we define a as the value of a corresponding to m = m̆, we can write
mt+1,i

so


covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i ) = covt á(Ra
t,i + ξt+1,i − m̆), Γpt,i .

But since R−1 (℘Rβ)1/ρ < á(m)
< ÞR,

Þat+1,i , pt+1,i )|
|covt ((℘Rβ)1/ρ at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < |covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < |covt (Þ

and for the version of the model with no permanent shocks the GIC says that Þ < Γ,
while the FHWC says that Γ < R
|covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < Γ|covt (at,i , pt,i )|.
This means that from any arbitrary starting value, the relative size of the covariance
term shrinks to zero over time (compared to the AΓn term which is growing steadily by
the factor Γ). Thus, limn→∞ At+n+1 /At+n = Γ.
This logic unfortunately does not go through when there are permanent shocks,
because the Rt+1,i terms are not independent of the permanent income shocks.
To see the problem clearly, define R̆ = M [Rt+1,i ] and consider a first order Taylor

expansion of á(m

á¯t+1,i ≈ á(
The problem comes from the á¯0 term. The concavity of the consumption function
implies convexity of the a function, so this term is strictly positive but we have no theory

a (locally) unboundedly positive effect on á¯0 (as for instance if it pushes the consumer
arbitrarily close to the self-imposed liquidity constraint).

F The Limiting MPC’s
For mt > 0 we can define et (mt ) = ct (mt )/mt and at (mt ) = mt − ct (mt ) and the Euler

Consider the first conditional expectation in (36), recalling that if ξt+1 > 0 then
ξt+1 ≡ θt+1 /(1 − ℘). Since limm↓0 at (m) = 0, Et [(et+1 (mt+1 )mt+1 Γt+1 )−ρ | ξt+1 > 0]
is contained within bounds defined by (et+1 (θ/(1 − ℘))Γψθ/(1 − ℘))−ρ and
(et+1 (θ̄/(1 − ℘))Γψ̄ θ̄/(1 − ℘))−ρ both of which are finite numbers, implying that
the whole term multiplied by (1 − ℘) goes to zero as mρt goes to zero. As mt ↓ 0
−ρ
the expectation in the other term goes to κ̄−ρ
t+1 (1 − κ̄t ) . (This follows from the strict
concavity and differentiability of the consumption function.) It follows that the limiting

(40)

lim κ̄T −n = κ̄ ≡ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R

(41)

Since κ̄T = 1, iterating (39) backward to infinity (because we are interested in the
limiting consumption function) we obtain:
n→∞

13

and we will therefore call κ̄ the ‘limiting maximal MPC.’
The minimal MPC’s are obtained by considering the case where mt ↑ ∞. If the
FHWC holds, then as mt ↑ ∞ the proportion of current and future consumption that
will be financed out of capital approaches 1. Thus, the terms involving ξt+1 in (36) can
be neglected, leading to a revised limiting Euler equation


(mt et (mt ))−ρ = βR Et (et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) (Rat (mt )))−ρ
and we know from L’Hôpital’s rule that limmt →∞ et (mt ) = κt , and limmt →∞ et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) =

For the purpose of constructing the limiting perfect foresight consumption function,

(44)

G The Perfect Foresight Liquidity Constrained
Solution as a Limit
Formally, suppose we change the description of the problem by making the following
two assumptions:
℘ =0
ct ≤ mt ,

14

and we designate the solution to this consumer’s problem c̀t (m). We will henceforth refer
to this as the problem of the ‘restrained’ consumer (and, to avoid a common confusion,
we will refer to the consumer as ‘constrained’ only in circumstances when the constraint
is actually binding).
Redesignate the consumption function that emerges from our original problem for a
given fixed ℘ as ct (m; ℘) where we separate the arguments by a semicolon to distinguish
between m, which is a state variable, and ℘, which is not. The proposition we wish to
demonstrate is
lim ct (m; ℘) = c̀t (m).
℘↓0

(45)

We will first examine the problem in period T − 1, then argue that the desired result
propagates to earlier periods. For simplicity, suppose that the interest, growth, and
time-preference factors are β = R = Γ = 1, and there are no permanent shocks, ψ = 1;
the results below are easily generalized to the full-fledged version of the problem.
The solution to the restrained consumer’s optimization problem can be obtained as
follows. Assuming that the consumer’s behavior in period T is given by cT (m) (in
practice, this will be cT (m) = m), consider the unrestrained optimization problem
)
(
Z θ̄
à∗T −1 (m) = arg max u(m − a) +
vT (a + θ)dFθ .

As usual, the envelope theorem tells us that vT0 (m) = u0 (cT (m)) so the expected
marginal value of ending period T − 1 with assets a can be defined as
Z θ̄
0
v̀T −1 (a) ≡
u0 (cT (a + θ))dFθ ,
θ

and the solution to (46) will satisfy
u0 (m − a) = v̀0T −1 (a).

(47)

à∗T −1 (m) therefore answers the question “With what level of assets would the restrained
consumer like to end period T − 1 if the constraint cT −1 ≤ mT −1 did not exist?” (Note
that the restrained consumer’s income process remains different from the process for
the unrestrained consumer so long as ℘ > 0.) The restrained consumer’s actual asset
position will be
àT −1 (m) = max[0, à∗T −1 (m)],
reflecting the inability of the restrained consumer to spend more than current resources,
and note (as pointed out by Deaton (1991)) that
−1/ρ
m1# = v̀0T −1 (0)
is the cusp value of m at which the constraint makes the transition between binding and
non-binding in period T − 1.

the Euler equation for the original consumer’s problem implies
(m − a)−ρ = v0T −1 (a; ℘)

(49)

with solution a∗T −1 (m; ℘). Now note that for any fixed a > 0, lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a).
Since the LHS of (47) and (49) are identical, this means that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) =
à∗T −1 (m). That is, for any fixed value of m > m1# such that the consumer subject
to the restraint would voluntarily choose to end the period with positive assets, the
level of end-of-period assets for the unrestrained consumer approaches the level for the
restrained consumer as ℘ ↓ 0. With the same a and the same m, the consumers must
have the same c, so the consumption functions are identical in the limit.
Now consider values m ≤ m1# for which the restrained consumer is constrained. It
is obvious that the baseline consumer will never choose a ≤ 0 because the first term
in (48) is lima↓0 ℘a−ρ = ∞, while lima↓0 (m − a)−ρ is finite (the marginal value of endof-period assets approaches infinity as assets approach zero, but the marginal utility of
consumption has a finite limit for m > 0). The subtler question is whether it is possible
to rule out strictly positive a for the unrestrained consumer.
The answer is yes. Suppose, for some m < m1# , that the unrestrained consumer is
considering ending the period with any positive amount of assets a = δ > 0. For any such
δ we have that lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a). But by assumption we are considering a set
of circumstances in which à∗T −1 (m) < 0, and we showed earlier that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) =
à∗T −1 (m). So, having assumed a = δ > 0, we have proven that the consumer would
optimally choose a < 0, which is a contradiction. A similar argument holds for m = m1# .
These arguments demonstrate that for any m > 0, lim℘↓0 cT −1 (m; ℘) = c̀T −1 (m) which
is the period T − 1 version of (45). But given equality of the period T − 1 consumption
functions, backwards recursion of the same arguments demonstrates that the limiting
consumption functions in previous periods are also identical to the constrained function.
Note finally that another intuitive confirmation of the equivalence between the two
problems is that our formula (41) for the maximal marginal propensity to consume
satisfies
lim κ̄ = 1,
℘↓0

which makes sense because the marginal propensity to consume for a constrained restrained consumer is 1 by our definitions of ‘constrained’ and ‘restrained.’

H Endogenous Gridpoints Solution Method
The model is solved using an extension of the method of endogenous gridpoints (Carroll
(2006)): A grid of possible values of end-of-period assets ~a is defined, and at these points,
marginal end-of-period-t value is computed as the discounted next-period expected

16

marginal utility of consumption (which the Envelope theorem says matches expected
marginal value). The results are then used to identify the corresponding levels of
consumption at the beginning of the period:11
u0 (ct (~a)) = Rβ Et [u0 (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))]
−1/ρ

.
~ct ≡ ct (~a) = Rβ Et (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))−ρ

(50)

The dynamic budget constraint can then be used to generate the corresponding m’s:
m
~ t = ~a + ~ct .
An approximation to the consumption function could be constructed by linear interpolation between the {m,
~ ~c} points. But a vastly more accurate approximation can be
made (for a given number of gridpoints) if the interpolation is constructed so that it also
matches the marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints. Differentiating (50) with
respect to a (and dropping policy function arguments for simplicity) yields a marginal
propensity to have consumed ca at each gridpoint:
u00 (ct )cat = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Γt+1 cm
t+1 Rt+1 ]
00
m
= Rβ Et [u (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rct+1 ]
a
00
ct = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rcm
t+1 ]/u (ct )

(51)

and the marginal propensity to consume at the beginning of the period is obtained from
the marginal propensity to have consumed by noting that, if we define m(a) = c(a) − a,
c=m−a
ca + 1 = ma
which, together with the chain rule ca = cm ma , yields the MPC from
cm (ca + 1) = ca
cm = ca /(1 + ca )
and we call the vector of MPC’s at the m
~ t gridpoints ~κt .

I The Terminal/Limiting Consumption Function
For any set of parameter values that satisfy the conditions required for convergence,
the problem can be solved by setting the terminal consumption function to cT (m) =
m and constructing {cT −1 , cT −2 , ...} by time iteration (a method that will converge to
c(m) by standard theorems). But cT (m) = m is very far from the final converged

11

The software can also solve a version of the model with explicit liquidity constraints, where the
Envelope condition does not hold.

17

consumption rule c(m),12 and thus many periods of iteration will likely be required to
obtain a candidate rule that even remotely resembles the converged function.
A natural alternative choice for the terminal consumption rule is the solution to the
perfect foresight liquidity constrained problem, to which the model’s solution converges
(under specified parametric restrictions) as all forms of uncertainty approach zero (as
discussed in the main text). But a difficulty with this idea is that the perfect foresight
liquidity constrained solution is ‘kinked:’ The slope of the consumption function changes
discretely at the points {m1# , m2# , ...}. This is a practical problem because it rules out
the use of derivatives of the consumption function in the approximate representation of
c(m), thereby preventing the enormous increase in efficiency obtainable from a higherorder approximation.
Our solution is simple: The formulae in another appendix that identify kink points on
c̊(m) for integer values of n (e.g., cn# = Þ −n
Γ ) are continuous functions of n; the conclusion
that c̊(m) is piecewise linear between the kink points does not require that the terminal
consumption rule (from which time iteration proceeds) also be piecewise linear. Thus,
for values n ≥ 0 we can construct a smooth function c̆(m) that matches the true perfect
foresight liquidity constrained consumption function at the set of points corresponding
to integer periods in the future, but satisfies the (continuous, and greater at non-kink
points) consumption rule defined from the appendix’s formulas by noninteger values of
n at other points.13
This strategy generates a smooth limiting consumption function – except at the
remaining kink point defined by {m0# , c0# }. Below this point, the solution must match
c(m) = m because the constraint is binding. At m = m0# the MPC discretely drops
(that is, limm↑m0# c0 (m) = 1 while limm↓m0# c0 (m) = κ0# < 1).
Such a kink point causes substantial problems for numerical solution methods (like the
one we use, described below) that rely upon the smoothness of the limiting consumption
function.
Our solution is to use, as the terminal consumption rule, a function that is identical
to the (smooth) continuous consumption rule c̆(m) above some n ≥ n, but to replace
c̆(m) between m0# and mn# with the unique polynomial function ĉ(m) that satisfies the
following criteria:
1. ĉ(m0# ) = c0#
2. ĉ0 (m0# ) = 1
n
) = (dcn# /dn)(dmn# /dn)−1 |n=n
3. ĉ0 (m#
n
4. ĉ00 (m#
) = (d2 cn# /dn2 )(d2 mn# /dn2 )−1 |n=n

where n is chosen judgmentally in a way calculated to generate a good compromise
between smoothness of the limiting consumption function c̆(m) and fidelity of that
function to the c̊(m) (see the actual code for details).
12

Unless β ≈ +0.
In practice, we calculate the first and second derivatives of c̊ and use piecewise polynomial
approximation methods that match the function at these points.
13

18

We thus define the terminal function as

0

0 < m ≤ m#
n
cT (m) = m0# < m < m#

 n
m# < m

m
c̆(m)
c̊(m)

(52)

Since the precautionary motive implies that in the presence of uncertainty the optimal
level of consumption is below the level that is optimal without uncertainty, and since
c̆(m) ≥ c̊(m), implicitly defining m = eµ (so that µ = log m), we can construct
χt (µ) = log(1 − ct (eµ )/cT (eµ ))

(53)

which must be a number between −∞ and +∞ (since 0 < ct (m) < c̆(m) for m > 0).
This function turns out to be much better behaved (as a numerical observation; no formal
proof is offered) than the level of the optimal consumption rule ct (m). In particular,
χt (µ) is well approximated by linear functions both as m ↓ 0 and as m ↑ ∞.
Differentiating with respect to µ and dropping consumption function arguments yields
  c0 c −c c0  
− t Tc2 t T eµ
T
0

(54)
χt (µ) = 
1 − ct /cT
which can be solved for
c0t = (ct c0T /cT ) − ((cT − ct )/m)χ0t .

(55)

Similarly, we can solve (53) for

ct (m) = 1 − eχt (log m) cT (m).

(56)

Thus, having approximated χt , we can recover from it the level and derivative(s) of
ct .

J Relational Diagrams for the Inequality Conditions
J.1 For the Unconstrained Perfect Foresight Model
Figure 2 Relation of RIC, PF-GIC, and FHWC in Perfect Foresight Model
Arrows reflect the direction of the relationship; an arrowhead points to the larger of the two quantities
being compared. For example, the topmost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, indicates that Γ > Þ .

Figure J.1 should be read as follows. The three nodes represent the values of the
absolute patience factor Þ, the growth factor for permanent income Γ, and the riskfree
interest factor R. The arrows between these quantities represent imposition of the labeled
condition. For example, the uppermost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, reflects imposition
of the PF-GIC condition. To make interpretation of the diagram easy, the mathematical

the condition.

which illustrates another aspect of the diagram: If all arrows are reversed in a partial
traversal of the diagram leading to a final step, then the arrow for the final step must
also be reversed. In this case, since both conditions leading to R have had their arrows
reversed, the arrow coming out of R should also be reversed, implying the negation of
the RIC – as (57) proved.
For clarity, further diagrams will omit multiple arrows indicating reversal of causality
(in Figure J.1 there would, for example, be only a single arrow, from Þ to Γ, at the top

Arrows reflect the direction of the relationship; an arrowhead points to the larger of the two quantities
being compared. For example, the topmost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ indicates that Γ > Þ .

After the warmup of constructing these conditions for the perfect foresight case, we
can represent the relationships between all the conditions in both the perfect foresight
case and the case with uncertainty as shown in Figure 4.

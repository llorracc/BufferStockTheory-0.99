Theoretical Foundations of
Buffer Stock Saving
October 14, 2020

Christopher D. Carroll1

Abstract
This paper builds theoretical foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding
of ‘buffer stock’ saving models, pairing each theoretical result with a quantitative
exploration. After describing conditions under which the consumption function exists,
the paper shows that a ‘target’ buffer stock exists only under conditions strictly
stronger than those that guarantee convergence of the consumption and value functions.
Furthermore, the average growth rate of consumption equals the average growth rate
of permanent income (in a small open economy populated by buffer stock savers).
Together, the (provided) numerical tools and (proven) analytical results constitute a
comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock models.

1 Introduction
In the presence of empirically realistic transitory and permanent shocks to income
a la Friedman (1957), only one further ingredient is required to construct a testable
model of optimal consumption: A description of preferences. Modelers usually
assume geometric discounting of a constant relative risk aversion utility function,
because, starting with Zeldes (1989) and Deaton (1991), a large literature has
shown that numerical solutions of such models have quantitative predictions that
can match microeconomic evidence reasonably well.
A companion theoretical literature has shown that numerical solution methods
provide good approximations to limiting “true” mathematical solutions – but
only for models more complex than the simple case with just shocks and utility.
The extra complexity has been required because standard contraction mapping
theorems (beginning with Bellman (1957) and including those building on Stokey
et. al. (1989)) cannot be applied when the utility function is unbounded (like
CRRA - see section 2.1).1
This paper’s first technical contribution is to articulate the (loose) conditions
under which the simple problem (without convenient shortcuts like a consumption
floor or liquidity constraints) defines a contraction mapping with a nondegenerate consumption function. The interesting requirement is a ‘Finite Value of
Autarky’ condition. The second contribution is to specify the conditions under
which the resulting consumption function implies existence of a ‘target’ wealth-topermanent-income ratio (the model exhibits ‘buffer stock’ saving behavior). Buffer
stock behavior arises when the model’s parameters satisfy a “Growth Impatience
Condition” (equation (31)) that relates preferences and uncertainty to predictable
income growth.
Even without a formal proof, target saving of this kind has been intuitively
understood to underlie central numerical results from the heterogeneous agent
macroeconomics literature; for example, the logic of target saving is central to
the explanation by Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016) of the fact that, during
the Great Recession, middle-class consumers cut their consumption more than
the poor or the rich. The theoretical logic articulated below explains this finding:
Learning that the future has become more uncertain does not change the urgent
imperatives of the poor (their high u0 (c) means they have little room to maneuver).
And, increased labor income uncertainty does not change the behavior of the
1 It is unclear whether newer methods such as those of Matkowski and Nowak (2011) could overcome this
problem, or how difficult it would be to do so; but in any case this particular problem does not seem to have
been tackled by those methods or any others.

rich because it does not threaten their consumption much. Only people in the
middle have both the motivation and the wiggle-room to reduce their discretionary
spending.
Conveniently, elements required for the convergence proof also provide analytical
foundations for many other results that have become familiar from the numerical
literature. In this paper, all theoretical conclusions are paired with numerically
computed illustrations (using the open-source Econ-ARK toolkit). The insights
of the paper are instantiated in the toolkit, whose buffer stock saving module
algorithmically flags parametric choices under which a problem fails to define a
contraction mapping; a target level of wealth does not exist; or the solution is
otherwise degenerate.
The theoretical foundations provided here are valuable both because they provide intuition about the determinants of saving targets, and because they make it
easier to develop reliable numerical solution methods (by providing necessary and
sufficient restrictions that solutions must satisfy).
The paper proceeds in three parts.
The first part articulates the conditions required for the problem to define a
nondegenerate limiting consumption function, and explains how the paper’s model
is more general than models previously considered in the literature. The conditions
required for convergence are interestingly parallel to those required for the liquidity
constrained perfect foresight model; that parallel is explored and explained. Next,
the paper derives some limiting properties of the consumption function as cash
approaches infinity and as it approaches its lower bound; then the theorem is
proven explaining when the problem defines a contraction mapping. Finally, a
related class of commonly-used models (exemplified by Deaton (1991)) is shown
to constitute a particular limit of this paper’s model.
The next section examines five key properties of the model. First, as cash
approaches infinity the expected growth rate of consumption and the marginal
propensity to consume (MPC) converge to their values in the perfect foresight
case. Second, as cash approaches zero the expected growth rate of consumption
approaches infinity, and the MPC approaches a simple analytical limit. Third,
if the consumer is ‘growth impatient,’ a unique target cash-to-permanent-income
ratio will exist. Fourth, at the target cash ratio, the expected growth rate of consumption is slightly less than the expected growth rate of permanent (noncapital)
income. Finally, the expected growth rate of consumption is declining in the level
of cash. The first four propositions are proven under general assumptions about
parameter values; the last is shown to hold if there are no transitory shocks, but
may fail in extreme cases if there are both transitory and permanent shocks.
Szeidl (2012) has shown that such an economy will be characterized by stable
invariant distributions for the consumption ratio, the wealth ratio, and other
variables.2 Using Szeidl’s result, the final section discusses conditions under which,
even with a fixed aggregate interest rate that differs from the time preference rate,
an economy populated by buffer stock consumers converges to a balanced growth
2 Szeidl’s proof supplants the analysis in an earlier draft of this paper, which conjectured the result and
provided supportive simulation evidence.

growth rate of permanent income.

2 The Problem
2.1 Setup
The consumer solves a standard optimization problem from the current period t
until the end of life at T :

where
u(•) = •1−ρ /(1 − ρ)

is a constant relative risk aversion utility function with ρ > 1.3 , 4 The consumer’s
initial condition is defined by market resources mt (Deaton (1991)’s ‘cash-onhand’) and permanent noncapital income pt .
In the usual treatment, a dynamic budget constraint (DBC) incorporates several
different elements that determine next period’s m (given this period’s choices); but
for the detailed analysis here, it will be useful to disarticulate the steps so that
individual ingredients can be separately examined:
at = mt − ct
bt+1 = at R
pt+1 = pt Γψt+1

(2)

| {z }
≡Γt+1

mt+1 = bt+1 + pt+1 ξt+1 ,
where at indicates the consumer’s assets at the end of period t, which grow
by a fixed interest factor R = (1 + r) between periods,5 so that bt+1 is the
consumer’s financial (‘bank’) balances before next period’s consumption choice;6
mt+1 (‘market resources’ or ‘money’) is the sum of financial wealth bt+1 and
noncapital income pt+1 ξt+1 (permanent noncapital income pt+1 multiplied by a
mean-one iid transitory income shock factor ξt+1 ; future transitory shocks are
assumed to satisfy Et [ξt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1). Permanent noncapital income in period
t + 1 is equal to its previous value, multiplied by a growth factor Γ, modified
by a mean-one iid shock ψt+1 , Et [ψt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1 satisfying ψ ∈ [ψ, ψ̄] for

3 The main results also hold for logarithmic utility which is the limit as ρ → 1 but incorporating the
logarithmic special case in the proofs is cumbersome and therefore omitted.
4 We will define the infinite horizon solution as the limit of the finite horizon problem as the horizon T − t
approaches infinity.
5 See Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2018) for interesting new work that considers the case where capital returns
are stochastic and liquidity constraints exist. Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) examines implications of capital
income risk for the distribution of wealth.
6 Allowing a stochastic interest factor is straightforward but adds little insight.

0 < ψ ≤ 1 ≤ ψ̄ < ∞ (and ψ = ψ̄ = 1 is the degenerate case with no permanent
shocks).7 , 8
In future periods t + n ∀ n ≥ 1 there is a small probability ℘ that income will
be zero (a ‘zero-income event’),
ξt+n =


0

with probability ℘ > 0
θt+n /(1 − ℘) with probability (1 − ℘)

(3)

where θt+n is an iid mean-one random variable (Et [θt+n ] = 1 ∀ n > 0) with
a distribution satisfying θ ∈ [θ, θ̄] where 0 < θ ≤ 1 ≤ θ̄ < ∞ (degenerately
θ = θ̄ = 1). (See Rabault (2002) and Li and Stachurski (2014) for analyses of
cases where the shock processes have unbounded support). Call the cumulative
distribution functions Fψ and Fθ (and Fξ is derived trivially from (3) and Fθ ).
Permanent income and cash start out strictly positive, {pt , mt } ∈ (0, ∞), and as
usual the consumer cannot die in debt, so
cT ≤ mT .

(4)

The model looks more special than it is. In particular, the assumption of a
positive probability of zero-income events may seem objectionable. However, it
is easy to show that a model with a nonzero minimum value of ξ (motivated,
for example, by the existence of unemployment insurance) can be redefined by
capitalizing the present discounted value of minimum income into current market
assets,9 analytically transforming that model back into the model analyzed here.
Also, the assumption of a positive point mass (as opposed to positive density) for
the worst realization of the transitory shock is inessential, but simplifies the proofs
and is a powerful aid to intuition.10
This model differs from Bewley’s (1977) classic formulation in several ways.
The CRRA utility function does not satisfy Bewley’s assumption that u(0) is well
defined, or that u0 (0) is well defined and finite; indeed, neither the value function
nor the marginal value function will be bounded. It differs from Schectman and
Escudero (1977) in that they impose liquidity constraints and positive minimum
income. It differs from both of these in that it permits permanent growth in
income, and also permanent shocks to income, which a large empirical literature
finds are quantitatively important in micro data11 and which since Friedman (1957)
have been understood to be far more consequential for household welfare than are
transitory fluctuations. It differs from Deaton (1991) because liquidity constraints
are absent; there are separate transitory and permanent shocks (a la Muth (1960));
7 It

is useful to emphasize that permanent noncapital income as defined here differs from what Deaton (1992)
calls permanent income (which is often adopted in the macro literature). Deaton defines permanent income as
the amount that a perfect foresight consumer could spend while leaving total (human and nonhuman) wealth
constant. Relatedly, we refer to mt as ‘cash-on-hand’ or ‘market resources’ rather than as wealth to avoid any
confusion for readers accustomed to thinking of the discounted value of future noncapital income as a part of
wealth. The ‘market resources’ terminology is motivated by the model’s assumption that human wealth cannot
be capitalized, an implication of anti-slavery laws.

and the transitory shocks here can occasionally cause income to reach zero.12
Finally, it differs from models found in Stokey et. al. (1989) because neither
liquidity constraints nor bounds on utility or marginal utility are imposed.13 , 14
The incorporation of permanent shocks rules out application of the tools of
Matkowski and Nowak (2011), who followed and corrected an error in the fundamental work on the local contraction mapping method developed in RincónZapatero and Rodríguez-Palmero (2003). Martins-da Rocha and Vailakis (2010)
provides a correction to Rincón-Zapatero and Rodríguez-Palmero (2003), and provides conditions that are easier to verify, but again only addresses the deterministic
case.

2.2 The Problem Can Be Rewritten in Ratio Form
We establish a bit more notation by reviewing the standard result that in problems
of this class (CRRA utility, permanent shocks) the number of relevant state
variables can be reduced from two (m and p) to one (m = m/p). Generically
defining nonbold variables as the boldface counterpart normalized by pt (as with
m in the previous sentence), assume that value in the last period of life is u(mT ),
and consider the problem in the second-to-last period,
u(cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(mT )]
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = max
c
T −1

= max u(pT −1 cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(pT mT )]

cT −1

(5)

where the last line follows because for the CRRA utility function (1), u(xy) =
x1−ρ u(y).
Now, in a one-time deviation from the notational convention established in the
last paragraph, define nonbold ‘normalized value’ not as vt /pt but as vt = vt /p1−ρ

problem’s first order condition is

t = Rβ Et [Γt+1 ct+1 ].

(7)

it will become clear that the Deaton model is a particular limit of this paper’s model.
restrictions to those in the cited literature are made in the well known papers by Scheinkman and
Weiss (1986) and Clarida (1987). See Toche (2005) for an elegant analysis of a related but simpler continuous-time
model.
14 Alvarez and Stokey (1998) relaxed the bounds on the return function, but they address only the deterministic
case.

Since vT (mT ) = u(mT ), defining vT −1 (mT −1 ) from (6), we obtain
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = pT1−ρ

This logic induces to all earlier periods, so that if we solve the normalized onestate-variable problem (6), we will have solutions to the original problem for any
t < T from:
vt (mt , pt ) = pt1−ρ vt (mt ),
ct (mt , pt ) = pt ct (mt ).

2.3 Definition of a Nondegenerate Solution
We say that this problem has a nondegenerate solution if, as the number of
remaining periods of life gets arbitrarily large, the backward-iterating solution
defines a unique limiting consumption function c(•) that satisfies
0 < c(m) < ∞

(8)

for every 0 < m < ∞. (‘Degenerate’ limits will be cases where the limiting
consumption function is c(m) = 0 or c(m) = ∞.)

2.4 Perfect Foresight Benchmarks
The familiar analytical solution to the perfect foresight specialization of the model,
obtained by setting ℘ = 0 and θ = θ̄ = ψ = ψ̄ = 1, allows us to define some
remaining notation and terminology, providing a convenient reference point.

(12)

Intuitively, for human wealth to be finite, the growth rate of (noncapital) income
must be smaller than the interest rate at which that income is being discounted.
2.4.2 Unconstrained Solution
The consumption Euler equation holds in every period; with u0 (c) = c−ρ ,
ct+1 /ct = (Rβ)1/ρ ≡ Þ

(13)

Þ < 1,

Þ R ≡ Þ /R

(15)

where the Old English letter ‘thorn’ represents what we will call the ‘absolute
patience factor’ (Rβ)1/ρ .15 The sense in which Þ captures patience is that if the
‘absolute impatience condition’ (AIC) holds,
the consumer will choose to spend an amount too large to sustain indefinitely (the
level of consumption must fall over time). We call such a consumer ‘absolutely
impatient’ (the key condition in Bewley (1977)).
We next define a ‘return patience factor’ that relates absolute patience to the
return factor:
and since consumption is growing by Þ but discounted by R:

(18)

where κt is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) because it answers the
question ‘if the consumer had an extra unit of wealth, how much more would be
spent.’ (The overbar on c reflects the fact that this will be an upper bound as
we modify the problem to incorporate constraints and uncertainty; analogously,
the underbar for κ indicates that it is a lower bound). Equation (17) makes plain
that for the limiting MPC to be strictly positive as n = T − t goes to infinity we
must impose the Return Impatience Condition (RIC):
Þ R < 1,

(19)

15 Impatience conditions of one kind or another have figured in intertemporal optimization problems since
such problems were first formalized in economics, most notably by Ramsey (1928). Discussion of these issues was
prominent in the literature of the 1960s and 1970s, and no brief citations here could do justice to the literature
on the topic, so I refrain from the attempt.

so that
0 < κ ≡ 1 − Þ R = n→∞
lim κT −n .

(20)

c̄(m) = (m + h − 1)κ,

(21)

The RIC thus imposes a second kind of ‘impatience:’ The consumer cannot be
so pathologically patient as to wish, in the limit as the horizon approaches infinity,
to spend nothing today out of an increase in current wealth; that is, the condition
rules out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = 0. Because the return patience
factor Þ R is the absolute patience factor divided by the return, we call equation
(19) the ‘return impatience condition’ or RIC; we will say that a consumer who
satisfies the condition is ‘return impatient.’
Given that the RIC holds, and defining limiting objects by the absence of a time
subscript (e.g., c̄(m) = limn↑∞ c̄T −n (m)), the limiting consumption function will
be
and we now see that in order to rule out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = ∞
we need h to be finite; that is, we must impose the finite human wealth condition
(12).
A final useful point is that since the perfect foresight growth factor for consumption is Þ , u(xy) = x1−ρ u(y) yields an analytical expression for value:
vt = u(ct ) + βu(ctÞ ) + β 2 u(ctÞ 2 ) + ...

Þ1−ρ < 1;16
which asymptotes to a finite number as n = T − t approaches +∞ if βÞ
with a bit of algebra,17 this requirement can be shown to be equivalent to the
RIC. Thus, the same conditions that guarantee a nondegenerate limiting consumption function also guarantee a nondegenerate limiting value function (which,
interestingly, will not be true in the version of the model below that incorporates
uncertainty).
2.4.3 Constrained Solution
If a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0 is ever to be relevant, it must be relevant at
the lowest possible level of market resources, mt = 1, which obtains for a consumer
who enters period t with bt = 0. The constraint is ‘relevant’ if it prevents the
choice that would otherwise be optimal; at mt = 1 the constraint is relevant if the
marginal utility from spending all of today’s resources ct = mt = 1, exceeds the

marginal utility from doing the same thing next period, ct+1 = 1; that is, if such
choices would violate the Euler equation (7):
1−ρ > Rβ(Γ)−ρ 1−ρ .

(23)

By analogy to the return patience factor, we therefore define a ‘perfect foresight
growth patience factor’ (PF-GPF) as
ÞΓ = Þ/Γ,

(24)

ÞΓ < 1

(25)

and define a ‘perfect foresight growth impatience condition’ (PF-GIC)
which is equivalent to (23) (exponentiate both sides by 1/ρ).
If the RIC (19) and the FHWC (12) hold, appendix A shows that, for some
0 < m# < 1, an unconstrained consumer behaving according to (21) would choose
c < m for all m > m# . The solution to the constrained consumer’s problem in
this case is simple: For any m ≥ m# the constraint does not bind (and will never
bind in the future) so the constrained consumption function is identical to the
unconstrained one. If the consumer were somehow18 to arrive at an m < m# < 1
the constraint would bind and the consumer would have to consume c = m. We
use the ◦ accent to designate the limiting constrained consumption function:
c̊(m) =


m

if m < m#
c̄(m) if m ≥ m# .

(26)

More useful is the case where the perfect foresight growth and return impatience
conditions both hold. In this case appendix A shows that the limiting constrained
consumption function is piecewise linear, with c̊(m) = m up to a first ‘kink
point’ at m1# > 1, and with discrete declines in the MPC at a set of kink
points {m1# , m2# , ...}. As m ↑ ∞ the constrained consumption function c̊(m)
becomes arbitrarily close to the unconstrained c̄(m), and the marginal propensity
κ(m) ≡ c̊0 (m) limits to κ. Similarly, the value function v̊(m)
to consume function κ̊
is nondegenerate and limits into the value function of the unconstrained consumer.
This logic holds even when the finite human wealth condition fails (denoted
 A solution exists because the constraint prevents the consumer from
FHWC):

borrowing against infinite human wealth to finance infinite current consumption.
Under these circumstances, the consumer who starts with any amount of resources
bt > 1 will, over time, run those resources down so that by some finite number of
periods n in the future the consumer will reach bt+n = 0, and thereafter will set
c = m = 1 for eternity, a policy that will (using (22)) yield value of

which we call the Perfect Foresight Finite Value of Autarky Condition, PF-FVAC,
because it guarantees that a consumer who always spends all permanent income

numbers: The component due to the unconstrained consumption choice made
over the finite horizon leading up to bt+n = 0, and the finite component due to the
value of consuming all pt+n thereafter (that is, for n > 0). The consumer’s value
function is therefore nondegenerate.
The most peculiar possibility occurs when the RIC fails. Under these circumstances the FHWC must also fail (Appendix A), and the constrained consumption
function is nondegenerate. (See Figure 6 for a numerical example). While it is true

Tables 3 and 4 (and appendix table 5) codify the key points to help the reader
keep them straight (and to facilitate upcoming comparisons with the results in the
presence of uncertainty but the absence of liquidity constraints (correspondingly
tabulated)). The model without constraints but with uncertainty will turn out to
be a close parallel to the model with constraints but without uncertainty.

where Jensen’s inequality guarantees that the expectation of the inverse of the
permanent shock is strictly greater than one. It will be convenient to define the

because this permits us to write expressions like the RHS of (28) compactly

11

as, e.g., at R/ψ −1 .19 We refer to this as the ‘compensated return,’ because it
compensates (in a risk-neutral way) for the effect of uncertainty on the expected
growth-normalized return (in the sense implicitly defined in (28)).
We can now transparently generalize the PF-GIC (25) by defining a ‘compensated growth factor’
Γ = Γψ

(29)

and a compensated Growth Patience Pactor (GPF):
Þ Γ = Þ /Γ
ψ̄

(30)
!

and a straightforward derivation ((44) below) yields the conclusion that
lim Et [mt+1 /mt ] = Þ Γ ,

mt →∞

which implies that if we wish to prevent m from heading to infinity (that is, if we
want m to be expected to fall for some large enough value of m) we must impose
a generalized version of the Perfect Foresight Growth Impatience Condition (25);
we call the ‘growth impatience condition’ (GIC) the requirement that the Growth
Patience Factor must be less than 1:20
ÞΓ < 1

(31)

which is stronger than the perfect foresight version (25) because Γ < Γ (Jensen’s
inequality implies that ψ < 1 for nondegenerate ψ).
2.5.2 Autarky Value
Analogously to (22), a consumer who spent exactly their permanent income every
period would have value determined by the product of the expectation of the
(independent) future shocks to permanent income:

vt = Et u(pt ) + βu(pt Γt+1 ) + ... + β T −t u(pt Γt+1 ...ΓT )

!

which invites the definition of a utility-compensated equivalent of the permanent
shock,
ψ = (E[ψ 1−ρ ])1/(1−ρ)
19 One way to think of ψ is as a particular kind of a ‘certainty equivalent’ of the shock; this captures the
intuition that mean-one shock renders a given mean level of income less valuable than if the shock did not exist,
so that ψ < 1.
20 Equation (31) is a bit easier to satisfy than the similar condition imposed by Deaton (1991):

which will satisfy ψ < 1 for ρ > 1 and nondegenerate ψ (and ψ < ψ for the
reasonable (though not required) case of ρ > 2); defining
Γ = Γψ

(32)

we can see that vt will be finite as T approaches ∞ if

βΓ1−ρ < 1

β < Γρ−1
which we call the ‘finite value of autarky’ condition (FVAC) because it guarantees
that value is finite for a consumer who always consumes their (now stochastic)
permanent income. For nondegenerate ψ, this condition is stronger (harder to
satisfy in the sense of requiring lower β) than the perfect foresight version (27)
because Γ < Γ.21

2.6 The Baseline Numerical Solution
Figure 1 depicts the successive consumption rules that apply in the last period
of life (cT (m)), the second-to-last period, and various earlier periods under the
baseline parameter values listed in Table 2. (The 45 degree line is labelled as
cT (m) = m because in the last period of life it is optimal to spend all remaining
resources.)
In the figure, the consumption rules appear to converge as the horizon recedes
(our purpose is to show that this appearance is not deceptive); we call the limiting
infinite-horizon consumption rule
c(m) ≡ lim cT −n (m).
n→∞

(34)

2.7 Concave Consumption Function Characteristics
A precondition for the main proof is that the maximization problem (6) defines a sequence of continuously differentiable strictly increasing strictly concave22
functions {cT , cT −1 , ...}.23 The straightforward but tedious proof is relegated to
appendix B. For present purposes, the most important point is the following
intuition: ct (m) < m for all periods t < T because a consumer who spent all
available resources would arrive in period t + 1 with balances bt+1 of zero, and
then might earn zero noncapital income over the remaining horizon (an unbroken

βR < RΓρ−1
(βR)1/ρ < R1/ρ Γ1−1/ρ ψ 1−1/ρ
Þ Γ < (R/Γ)1/ρ ψ 1−1/ρ

where the last equation is the same as the PF-FVAC condition except that the RHS is multiplied by ψ 1−1/ρ
which is strictly less than 1.
22 There is one obvious exception: c (m) is a linear (and so only weakly concave) function.

series of zero-income events is unlikely but possible). In such a case, the budget
constraint and the can’t-die-in-debt condition mean that the consumer would be
forced to spend zero, incurring negative infinite utility. To avoid this disaster, the
consumer never spends everything. (This is an example of the ‘natural borrowing
constraint’ induced by a precautionary motive, per Zeldes (1989)).24

2.8 Bounds for the Consumption Functions
The consumption functions depicted in Figure 1 appear to have limiting slopes as
m ↓ 0 and as m ↑ ∞. This section confirms that impression and derives those
slopes, which also turn out to be useful in the contraction mapping proof.25 , 26
Assume (as discussed above) that a continuously differentiable concave consumption function exists in period t + 1, with an origin at ct+1 (0) = 0, a minimal
MPC κt+1 > 0, and maximal MPC κ̄t+1 ≤ 1. (If t + 1 = T these will be
κT = κ̄T = 1; for earlier periods they will exist by recursion from the following
arguments.)
The MPC bound as wealth approaches infinity is easy to understand: In this
case, under our imposed assumption that human wealth is finite, the proportion
of consumption that will be financed out of human wealth approaches zero. The
consequence is that the proportional difference between the solution to the model
with uncertainty and the perfect foresight model shrinks to zero.
In the course of proving this, appendix F provides a recursive expression for the
(inverse of the) limiting MPC:
−1
κ−1
t = 1 + Þ R κt+1 .

(35)

2.8.1 Weak RIC Conditions

Then κ̄−1

factor’ ℘1/ρÞ R satisfies:

a condition that we dub the ‘Weak Return Impatience Condition’ (WRIC) because
with ℘ < 1 it will hold more easily (for a larger set of parameter values) than the
ÞR < 1).
RIC (Þ
24 It would perhaps be better to call it the ‘utility-induced borrowing constraint’ as it follows from the
assumptions on the utility function (in particular, limc↓0 u(c) = −∞); for example, no such constraint arises
if utility is of the (implausible) Constant Absolute Risk Aversion form.
25 Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) show that the consumption function becomes linear as wealth approaches
infinity in a model with capital income risk and liquidity constraints; their results should generalize to the limits
derived here if capital income risk were added to the model.
26 Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2020) establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general income
fluctuation problem with capital income risk in a Markovian setting and use such a model to study the tail
behavior of wealth in the presence of risky returns to capital.

16

The essence of the argument is that as wealth approaches zero, the overriding
consideration that limits consumption is the (recursive) fear of the zero income
events. (That consideration is why the probability of the zero income event ℘
appears in the expression.)
We are now in position to observe that the optimal consumption function must
satisfy
κt mt ≤ct (mt ) ≤ κ̄t mt

(38)

because consumption starts at zero and is continuously differentiable (as argued
above), is strictly concave (Carroll and Kimball (1996)), and always exhibits a
slope between κt and κ̄t (the formal proof is provided in appendix D).
These limits are useful at least in the sense that they can be hard-wired into
a solution algorithm for the model, which has the potential to make the solution
more efficient (cf. Carroll, Chipeniuk, Tokuoka, and Wu (2020)). Alternatively,
they can provide a useful check on the accuracy of a solution algorithm that does
not impose them directly.

2.9 Conditions Under Which the Problem Defines a Contraction
Mapping
To prove that the consumption rules converge, we need to show that the problem
defines a contraction mapping. This cannot be proven using the standard theorems
in, say, Stokey et. al. (1989), which require marginal utility to be bounded over
the space of possible values of m, because the possibility (however unlikely) of
an unbroken string of zero-income events for the remainder of life means that
as m approaches zero c must approach zero (see the discussion in 2.7); thus,
marginal utility is unbounded. Although a recent literature examines the existence
and uniqueness of solutions to Bellman equations in the presence of ‘unbounded
returns’ (see, e.g., Matkowski and Nowak (2011)), the techniques in that literature
cannot be used to solve the problem here because the required conditions are
violated by a problem that involves permanent shocks.27
Fortunately, Boyd (1990) provided a weighted contraction mapping theorem
that Alvarez and Stokey (1998) showed could be used to address the homogeneous
case (of which CRRA formulation is an example) in a deterministic framework;
later, Durán (2003) showed how to extend the Boyd (1990) approach to the
stochastic case.
Definition 1. Consider any function • ∈ C(A, B) where C(A, B) is the space of
continuous functions from A to B. Suppose z ∈ C(A, B) with B ⊆ R and z > 0.
Then • is z-bounded if the z-norm of •,
| • (m)|
,
k • kz = sup
z(m)
m
#

"

(39)

is finite.
27 See Yao (2012) for a detailed discussion of the reasons the existing literature up through Matkowski and
Nowak (2011) cannot handle the problem described here.

17

For Cz (A, B) defined as the set of functions in C(A, B) that are z-bounded; w,
x, y, and z as examples of z-bounded functions; and using 0(m) = 0 to indicate
the function that returns zero for any argument, Boyd (1990) proves the following.
Boyd’s Weighted Contraction Mapping Theorem. Let T : Cz (A, B) →
C (A, B) such that 28 , 29
(1)T is non-decreasing, i.e. x ≤ y ⇒ {Tx} ≤ {Ty}
(2){T0} ∈ Cz (A, B)
(3)There exists some real 0 < α < 1, such that
{T(w + ζz)} ≤ {Tw} + ζαz holds for all real ζ > 0 .
Then T defines a contraction with a unique fixed point.
For our problem, take A as R>0 and B as R, and define
h

i

1−ρ
{Ez}(at ) = Et Γt+1
z(at Rt+1 + ξt+1 ) .

Using this, we introduce the mapping T : Cz (A, B) → C (A, B),30
{Tz}(mt ) =

max

ct ∈[κmt ,κ̄mt ]

u(ct ) + β ({Ez}(mt − ct )) .

(40)

We can show that our operator T satisfies the conditions that Boyd requires
of his operator T, if we impose two restrictions on parameter values. The first is
the WRIC necessary for convergence of the maximal MPC, equation (37) above.
A more serious restriction is the utility-compensated Finite Value of Autarky
condition, equation (33). (We discuss the interpretation of these restrictions in
detail in section 2.11 below.) Imposing these restrictions, we are now in position
to state the central theorem of the paper.
Theorem 1. T is a contraction mapping if the restrictions on parameter values
(37) and (33) are true (that is, if the weak return impatience condition and the
finite value of autarky condition hold).
Intuitively, Boyd’s theorem shows that if you can find a z that is everywhere
finite but goes to infinity ‘as fast or faster’ than the function you are normalizing
with z, the normalized problem defines a contraction mapping. The intuition for
the FVAC condition is just that, with an infinite horizon, with any initial amount
of bank balances b0 , in the limit your value can always be made greater than you
would get by consuming exactly your permanent income every period (say, by
consuming (r/R)b0 −  for some small  > 0).
The details of the proof are cumbersome, and are therefore relegated to appendix D. Given that the value function converges, appendix D.3 shows that the
consumption functions converge.

28 We

will usually denote the function that results from the mapping as, e.g., {Tw}.
non-theorists, this notation may be slightly confusing; the inequality relations in (1) and (3) are taken
to mean ‘for any specific element • in the domain of the functions in question’ so that, e.g., x ≤ y is short for
x(•) ≤ y(•) ∀ • ∈ A. In this notation, ζαz in (3) is a function which can be applied to any argument • (because
z is a function).
30 Note that the existence of the maximum is assured by the continuity of {Ez}(a ) (it is continuous because
t
it is the sum of continuous z-bounded functions z) and the compactness of [κmt , κ̄mt ].

2.10 The Liquidity Constrained Solution as a Limit
This section shows that a related problem commonly considered in the literature
(e.g., with a simpler income process, by Deaton (1991)), with a liquidity constraint
and a positive minimum value of income, is the limit of the problem considered
here as the probability ℘ of the zero-income event approaches zero.
The essence of the argument is easy to state. As noted above, there is a finite
possibility of earning zero income over the remainder of the horizon, which prevents
the consumer from ending the current period with zero assets because with some
finite probability the consumer would be forced to consume zero, which would be
infinitely painful.
But the extent to which the consumer feels the need to make this precautionary
provision depends on the probability that it will turn out to matter. As ℘ ↓ 0,
that probability becomes arbitrarily small, so the amount of precautionary saving
approaches zero. But zero precautionary saving is the amount of saving that a
liquidity constrained consumer with perfect foresight would choose.
Another way to think about this is just to think of the liquidity constraint
as being imposed by specifying a component of the utility function that is zero
whenever the consumer ends the period with (strictly) positive assets, but negative
infinity if the consumer ended the period with (weakly) negative assets.
See appendix G for the formal proof justifying the foregoing intuitive discussion.

2.11 Discussion of Parametric Restrictions
2.11.1 The RIC
In the perfect foresight unconstrained problem (section 2.4.2), the RIC was required for existence of a nondegenerate solution. It is surprising, therefore, that
in the presence of uncertainty, the RIC is neither necessary nor sufficient for a
nondegenerate solution. We thus begin our discussion by asking what features the
problem must exhibit (given the FVAC) if the RIC fails (that is, R < (Rβ)1/ρ ):
implied by FVAC

}|

{

R < (Rβ)1/ρ < (R(Γψ)ρ−1 )1/ρ
R < (R/Γ)1/ρ Γψ 1−1/ρ
R/Γ < (R/Γ)1/ρ ψ 1−1/ρ
(R/Γ)1−1/ρ < ψ 1−1/ρ

(41)

but since ψ < 1 and 0 < 1 − 1/ρ < 1 (because we have assumed ρ > 1),
this can hold only if R/Γ < 1; that is, given the FVAC, the RIC can fail only
if human wealth is unbounded. Unbounded human wealth is permitted here,
as in the perfect foresight liquidity constrained problem. But, from equation
 is that lim


(35), an implication of 
RIC
m↑∞ c (m) = 0. Thus, interestingly, the
presence of uncertainty both permits unlimited human wealth and at the same
time prevents that unlimited wealth from resulting in infinite consumption. That
is, in the presence of uncertainty, pathological patience (which in the perfect

19

foresight model with finite wealth results in consumption of zero) plus infinite
human wealth (which the perfect foresight model rules out because it leads to
infinite consumption) combine here to yield a unique finite limiting MPC for any
finite value of m. Note the close parallel to the conclusion in the perfect foresight
 case (for detailed analysis of this

liquidity constrained model in the {PF-GIC,
RIC}
case see the appendix). There, too, the tension between infinite human wealth
and pathological patience was resolved with a nondegenerate consumption function
whose limiting MPC was zero.
2.11.2 The WRIC
The ‘weakness’ of the additional requirement for contraction, the weak RIC, can
be seen by asking ‘under what circumstances would the FVAC hold but the
WRIC fail?’ Algebraically, the requirement is
βΓ1−ρ ψ 1−ρ < 1 < (℘β)1/ρ /R1−1/ρ .

(42)

If there were no conceivable parameter values that could satisfy both of these
inequalities, the WRIC would have no force; it would be redundant. And if we
require R ≥ 1, the WRIC is indeed redundant because now β < 1 < Rρ−1 , so that
the RIC (and WRIC) must hold.
But neither theory nor evidence demands that we assume R ≥ 1. We can
therefore approach the question of the WRIC’s relevance by asking just how low
R must be for the condition to be relevant. Suppose for illustration that ρ = 2,
ψ 1−ρ = 1.01, Γ1−ρ = 1.01−1 and ℘ = 0.10. In that case (42) reduces to
β < 1 < (0.1β/R)1/2
but since β < 1 by assumption, the binding requirement is that
R < β/10
so that for example if β = 0.96 we would need R < 0.096 (that is, a perpetual
riskfree rate of return of worse than -90 percent a year) in order for the WRIC to
bind. The relevance of the WRIC is indeed “Weak.”
Perhaps the best way of thinking about this is to note that the space of parameter values for which the WRIC is relevant shrinks out of existence as ℘ → 0,
which section 2.10 showed was the precise limiting condition under which behavior
becomes arbitrarily close to the liquidity constrained solution (in the absence of
other risks). On the other hand, when ℘ = 1, the consumer has no noncapital
income (so that the FHWC holds) and with ℘ = 1 the WRIC is identical to the
RIC; but the RIC is the only condition required for a solution to exist for a perfect
foresight consumer with no noncapital income. Thus the WRIC forms a sort of
‘bridge’ between the liquidity constrained and the unconstrained problems as ℘
moves from 0 to 1.

2.11.3 When the GIC Fails
If both the GIC and the RIC hold, the arguments above establish that the limiting
consumption function asymptotes to the consumption function for the perfect
foresight unconstrained function. The more interesting case is where the GIC fails.

GIC
The consumption function is shown along with the Et [∆mt+1 ] = 0 locus that
identifies the ‘sustainable’ level of spending at which m is expected to remain
unchanged. The diagram suggests a fact that is confirmed by deeper analysis:
Under the depicted configuration of parameter values (see the code for details),
the consumption function never reaches the Et [∆mt+1 ] = 0 locus; indeed, when
the RIC holds but the GIC does not, the consumption function’s limiting slope
Þ/R) is shallower than that of the sustainable consumption locus (1 − Γ/R),31
(1 −Þ
so the gap between the two actually increases with m in the limit. Although a
nondegenerate consumption function exists, a target level of m does not (or, rather,
the target is m = ∞), because no matter how wealthy a consumer becomes, the
consumer will always spend less than the amount that would keep m stable (in
expectation).
For the reader’s convenience, Tables 3 and 4 present a summary of the connections between the various conditions in the presence and the absence of uncertainty.

31 This

is because Et [mt+1 ] = Et [Rt+1 (mt − ct )] + 1; solve m = (m − c)Rψ −1 + 1 for c and differentiate.

3 Analysis of the Converged Consumption
Function
Figures 3 and 4a,b capture the main properties of the converged consumption
rule when the RIC, GIC, and FHWC all hold.32 Figure 3 shows the expected
consumption growth factor Et [ct+1 /ct ] for a consumer behaving according to the
converged consumption rule, while Figures 4a,b illustrate theoretical bounds for
the consumption function and the marginal propensity to consume.
Five features of behavior are captured, or suggested, by the figures. First, as
mt ↑ ∞ the expected consumption growth factor goes to Þ , indicated by the
lower bound in Figure 3, and the marginal propensity to consume approaches
κ = (1 − Þ R ) (Figure 4), the same as the perfect foresight MPC.33 Second, as
mt ↓ 0 the consumption growth factor approaches ∞ (Figure 3) and the MPC
approaches κ̄ = (1 − ℘1/ρÞR ) (Figure 4). Third (Figure 3), there is a target cashon-hand-to-income ratio m̌ such that if mt = m̌ then Et [mt+1 ] = mt , and (as
indicated by the arrows of motion on the Et [ct+1 /ct ] curve), the model’s dynamics
are ‘stable’ around the target in the sense that if mt < m̌ then cash-on-hand will
rise (in expectation), while if mt > m̌, it will fall (in expectation). Fourth (Figure
3), at the target m, the expected rate of growth of consumption is slightly less than
the expected growth rate of permanent noncapital income. The final proposition
suggested by Figure 3 is that the expected consumption growth factor is declining
in the level of the cash-on-hand ratio mt . This turns out to be true in the absence
of permanent shocks, but in extreme cases it can be false if permanent shocks are
present.34
32 These

figures reflect the converged rule corresponding to the parameter values indicated in Table 2.
the RIC fails, the limiting minimal MPC is 0; see appendix.
34 Throughout the remaining analysis I make a final assumption that is not strictly justified by the foregoing.

which is the solution to an infinite-horizon problem with no noncapital income
(ξt+n = 0 ∀ n ≥ 1); clearly c(m) < c(m), since allowing the possibility of future
noncapital income cannot reduce current consumption.35
Assuming the FHWC holds, the infinite horizon perfect foresight solution (21)
constitutes an upper bound on consumption in the presence of uncertainty, since
Carroll and Kimball (1996) show that the introduction of uncertainty strictly
decreases the level of consumption at any m.
Thus, we can write
c(m) <c(m) < c̄(m)
1 <c(m)/c(m) < c̄(m)/c(m).

(43)

We have seen that the finite-horizon consumption functions cT −n (m) are twice continuously differentiable and
strictly concave, and that they converge to a continuous function c(m). It does not strictly follow that the limiting
function c(m) is twice continuously differentiable, but I will assume that it is.
35 We will assume the RIC holds here and subsequently so that κ > 0; the situation is a bit more complex
when the RIC does not hold. In that case the bound on consumption is given by the spending that would be
undertaken by a consumer who faced binding liquidity constraints. Detailed analysis of this special case is not
sufficiently interesting to warrant inclusion in the paper.

Hence we have

so as cash goes to infinity, consumption growth approaches its value Þ in the
perfect foresight model.
This argument applies equally well to the problem of the restrained consumer,
because as m approaches infinity the constraint becomes irrelevant (assuming the
FHWC holds).

3.2 Limits as mt ↓ 0
Now consider the limits of behavior as mt gets arbitrarily small.
Equation (36) shows that the limiting value of κ̄ is
κ̄ = 1 − R−1 (℘Rβ)1/ρ .
Defining e(m) = c(m)/m as before we have
lim e(m) = (1 − ℘1/ρÞ R ) = κ̄.

with L’Hôpital’s rule, we have

3.3 There Exists Exactly One Target Cash-on-Hand Ratio, which
is Stable
We now prove the existence of a target cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ towards
which an agent’s m expects to move. (The ∨ accent is meant to invoke the fact
that this is the value that other m’s ‘point to.’) We state the necessary conditions
for the existence of m̌ and its properties in the following theorem.
Theorem 2. For the problem defined in section 2.1, if the GIC (31), and WRIC
(37), then there exists a unique cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ > 0 such that
Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1 if mt = m̌.

(46)

Moreover, m̌ is stable in the sense that
∀mt ∈ (0, m̌), Et [mt+1 ] > mt
∀mt ∈ (m̌, ∞), Et [mt+1 ] < mt .

(47)

The elements of the proof are:
• Existence and continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ]
• Existence of a point where Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
• Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing
3.3.1 Existence and Continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ].
The consumption function exists because we have imposed the conditions (the
WRIC and FVAC) that theorem 1 establishes are sufficient for its existence. (Indeed, Appendix C shows that c(m) is not just continuous, but twice continuously
differentiable.)
Section 2.7 shows that for all t, at−1 = mt−1 − ct−1 > 0. Since mt = at−1 Rt + yt ,
even if yt takes on its minimum value of 0, at−1 Rt > 0, since both at−1 and
Rt are strictly positive under our foregoing assumptions. With mt > 0, the ratio
Et [mt+1 /mt ] inherits continuity (and, for that matter, continuous differentiability)
from the consumption function.

37 The

same arguments establish limm↓0 Et [ct+1 /ct ] = ∞ for the problem of the restrained consumer.

where the last two lines are merely a restatement of the GIC (31).
The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if Et [mt+1 /mt ] is continuous, and
takes on values above and below 1, there must be at least one point at which it is
equal to one.
3.3.3 Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing.
Now define ζ (mt ) ≡ Et [mt+1 ] − mt and note that
ζ (mt ) < 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] < 1
ζ (mt ) = 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
ζ (mt ) > 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] > 1,

The foregoing arguments rely on the continuous differentiability of c(m), so the
arguments do not directly go through for the restrained consumer’s problem in
which the existence of liquidity constraints can lead to discrete changes in the
slope c0 (m) at particular values of m. But we can use the fact that the restrained
model is the limit of the baseline model as ℘ ↓ 0 to conclude that there is likely a
unique target cash level even in the restrained model.
If consumers are sufficiently impatient, the limiting target level in the restrained
model will be m̌ = Et [ξt+1 ] = 1. That is, if a consumer starting with m = 1 will
save nothing, a(1) = 0, then the target level of m in the restrained model will be
1; if a consumer with m = 1 would choose to save something, then the target level
of cash-on-hand will be greater than the expected level of income.

3.4 Expected Consumption Growth at Target m Is Less than
Expected Permanent Income Growth
In Figure 3 the intersection of the target cash-on-hand ratio locus at m̌ with the
expected consumption growth curve lies below the intersection with the horizontal
line representing the growth rate of expected permanent income. This can be
proven as follows.
Strict concavity of the consumption function implies that if Et [mt+1 ] = m̌ = mt

and since mt+1 = (R/Γt+1 )a(m̌) + ξt+1 and a(m̌) > 0 it is clear that
covt (Γt+1 , mt+1 ) < 0 which implies that the entire term added to Γ in (52)
is negative, as required.

3.5 Expected Consumption Growth Is a Declining Function of mt
(or Is It?)
Figure 3 depicts the expected consumption growth factor as a strictly declining
function of the cash-on-hand ratio. To investigate this, define
Υ (mt ) ≡ Γt+1 c(Rt+1 a(mt ) + ξt+1 )/c(mt ) = ct+1 /ct
and the proposition in which we are interested is

(53)

Henceforth indicating appropriate arguments by the corresponding subscript
(e.g. c0t+1 ≡ c0 (mt+1 )), since Γt+1 Rt+1 = R, the portion of the LHS of equation
(53) in brackets can be manipulated to yield
ctΥ 0t+1 = c0t+1 at0 R − c0t Γt+1 ct+1 /ct
= c0t+1 at0 R − c0tΥ t+1 .

but since Υ t+1 > 0 we can see from (55) that (53) is equivalent to

covt (Γψt+1 c(mt+1 ))−ρ−1 , c0 (mt+1 ) > 0.
The two shocks cause two kinds of variation in mt+1 . Variations due to ξt+1
satisfy the proposition, since a higher draw of ξ both reduces c−ρ−1
and reduces
t+1
the marginal propensity to consume. However, permanent shocks have conflicting
effects. On the one hand, a higher draw of ψt+1 will reduce mt+1 , thus increasing
both c−ρ−1
and c0t+1 . On the other hand, the c−ρ−1
term is multiplied by Γψt+1 ,
t+1
t+1
so the effect of a higher ψt+1 could be to decrease the first term in the covariance,
leading to a negative covariance with the second term. (Analogously, a lower
permanent shock ψt+1 can also lead a negative correlation.)
The software archive associated with this paper presents an example in which
this perverse effect dominates. However, extreme assumptions were required (in
particular, a very small probability of the zero-income shock) and the region in
Υ0t+1 ] < 0
which Υ 0t+1 > 0 was tiny. In practice, for plausible parametric choices, Et [Υ
should generally hold.

4 The Aggregate and Idiosyncratic Relationship
Between Consumption Growth and Income
Growth
This section examines the behavior of large collections of buffer-stock consumers
with identical parameter values. Such a collection can be thought of as either a
subset of the population within a single country (say, members of a given education
or occupation group), or as the whole population in a small open economy.39
Formally, we assume a continuum of ex ante identical households on the unit
interval, with constant total mass normalized to one and indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], all
behaving according to the model specified above.40
Szeidl (2012) proves that such a population will be characterized by an invariant

39 We will continue to take the aggregate interest rate as exogenous and constant. It is also possible, and only
slightly more difficult, to solve for the steady-state of a closed-economy version of the model where the interest
rate is endogenous.
40 One inconvenient aspect of the model as specified is that it does not exhibit a stationary distribution of
idiosyncratic permanent noncapital income; the longer the economy lasts, the wider is the distribution. This
problem can be remedied by assuming a constant probability of death, and replacing deceased households with
newborns whose initial idiosyncratic permanent income matches the mean idiosyncratic permanent income of
the population. For a fully worked-out general equilibrium version of such a model, see Carroll, Slacalek, and
Tokuoka (2015).

distribution of m that induces invariant distributions for c and a; designate these
F m , F a , and F c .41

4.1 Consumption and Income Growth at the Household Level
It is useful to define the operator M [•] which yields the mean value of its argument
in the population, as distinct from the expectations operator E [•] which represents
beliefs about the future.
An economist with a microeconomic dataset could calculate the average growth
rate of idiosyncratic consumption, and would find
M [∆ log ct+1 ] = M [log ct+1 pt+1 − log ct pt ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt + log ct+1 − log ct ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt ] + M [log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2) + M[log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2)
where γ = log Γ and the last equality follows because the invariance of F c (see
Szeidl (2012)) means that M [log ct+n ] = M [log ct ].42
Thus, in a population that has reached its invariant distribution, the growth
rate of idiosyncratic log consumption matches the growth rate of idiosyncratic log
permanent income.

4.2 Growth Rates of Aggregate Income and Consumption
Attanasio and Weber (1995) point out that concavity of the consumption function
(or other nonlinearities) can imply that it is quantitatively important to distinguish
between the growth rate of average consumption and the average growth rate of
consumption.43 We have just examined the average growth rate; we now examine
the growth rate of the average.
Using boldface capital letters for aggregate variables, the growth factor for
aggregate income is given by:
Yt+1 /Yt = M [ξt+1 Γψt+1 pt ] /M [pt ξt ]
=Γ
because of the independence assumptions we have made about ξ and ψ.
The growth factor for aggregate assets is:

proof supplants simulation evidence of ergodicity that appeared in an earlier version of this paper.
in the simulation literature have observed an approximate equivalence between the average growth
rates of idiosyncratic consumption and permanent income, but formal proof was not possible until Szeidl’s proof
of ergodicity.
43 Since we assume number of the households are normalized to 1, aggregate and average variables are identical.

where the second-to-last line follows from Szeidl (2012)’s proof the ergodicity
of the distributions of normalized variables for this problem, which implies that
M[at+1 − at ] = 0.
Unfortunately, it is clear that the covariance term in the numerator, while
generally small, will not in general be zero. This is because the realization of
the permanent shock ψt+1 has a nonlinear effect on at+1 .
One way of thinking about this is that it reflects the fact that, under our
assumptions, the p variable does not have an ergodic distribution; the distribution
of permanent income becomes forever wider and wider as time progress in this
model.
There is a simple solution to that problem, however. In practice most modelers
incorporate a constant positive probability of death in their models, following
Blanchard (1985). Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2017) show that for
probabilities of death that exceed a threshold that depends on the size of the
permanent shocks, the distribution of permanent income has a finite variance.
In such cases, numerical results confirm the intuition that the growth rate of
aggregate assets ends up matching the growth rate of permanent income.
Matters are simpler if there are no permanent shocks; see E for a proof that in
that case the growth rate of assets (and other variables) does eventually converge
to the growth rate of aggregate permanent income.

5 Conclusions
This paper provides theoretical foundations for many characteristics of buffer stock
saving models that have heretofore been observed in numerical solutions but not
proven. Perhaps the most important such proposition is the existence of a target
cash-to-permanent-income ratio toward which actual resources will move. The
intuition provided by the existence of such a target can be a powerful aid to
understanding a host of numerical results.
Another contribution is integration of the paper’s results with the open-source
Econ-ARK toolkit, which is used to generate all of the quantitative results of the
paper, and which integrally incorporates all of the analytical insights of the paper.

Theoretical Foundations of
Buffer Stock Saving
October 18, 2020

Christopher D. Carroll1

Abstract
This paper builds theoretical foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding of ‘buffer
stock’ saving models, pairing each theoretical result with a quantitative exploration. After
describing conditions under which the consumption function exists, the paper shows that a
‘target’ buffer stock exists only under conditions strictly stronger than those that guarantee
convergence of the consumption and value functions. Furthermore, the average growth rate of
consumption equals the average growth rate of permanent income (in a small open economy
populated by buffer stock savers). Together, the (provided) numerical tools and (proven)
analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock models.

1 Introduction
In the presence of empirically realistic transitory and permanent shocks to income a la
Friedman (1957), only one further ingredient is required to construct a testable model of
optimal consumption: A description of preferences. Modelers usually assume geometric
discounting of a constant relative risk aversion utility function, because, starting with
Zeldes (1989) and Deaton (1991), a large literature has shown that numerical solutions
of such models have quantitative predictions that can match microeconomic evidence
reasonably well.
A companion theoretical literature has shown that numerical solution methods provide
good approximations to limiting “true” mathematical solutions – but only for models
more complex than the simple case with just shocks and utility. The extra complexity has
been required because standard contraction mapping theorems (beginning with Bellman
(1957) and including those building on Stokey et. al. (1989)) cannot be applied when
the utility function is unbounded (like CRRA - see section 2.1).1
This paper’s first technical contribution is to articulate the (loose) conditions under
which the simple problem (without convenient shortcuts like a consumption floor or
liquidity constraints) defines a contraction mapping with a nondegenerate consumption
function. The interesting requirement is a ‘Finite Value of Autarky’ condition. The
second contribution is to specify the conditions under which the resulting consumption
function implies existence of a ‘target’ wealth-to-permanent-income ratio (the model
exhibits ‘buffer stock’ saving behavior). Buffer stock behavior arises when the model’s
parameters satisfy a “Growth Impatience Condition” (equation (31)) that relates preferences and uncertainty to predictable income growth.
Even without a formal proof, target saving of this kind has been intuitively understood
to underlie central numerical results from the heterogeneous agent macroeconomics
literature; for example, the logic of target saving is central to the explanation by
Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016) of the fact that, during the Great Recession, middleclass consumers cut their consumption more than the poor or the rich. The theoretical
logic articulated below explains this finding: Learning that the future has become more
uncertain does not change the urgent imperatives of the poor (their high u0 (c) means
they have little room to maneuver). And, increased labor income uncertainty does not
change the behavior of the rich because it does not threaten their consumption much.
1 It is unclear whether newer methods such as those of Matkowski and Nowak (2011) could overcome this problem,
or how difficult it would be to do so; but in any case this particular problem does not seem to have been tackled by those
methods or any others.

Only people in the middle have both the motivation and the wiggle-room to reduce their
discretionary spending.
Conveniently, elements required for the convergence proof also provide analytical
foundations for many other results that have become familiar from the numerical literature. In this paper, all theoretical conclusions are paired with numerically computed
illustrations (using the open-source Econ-ARK toolkit). The insights of the paper
are instantiated in the toolkit, whose buffer stock saving module algorithmically flags
parametric choices under which a problem fails to define a contraction mapping; a target
level of wealth does not exist; or the solution is otherwise degenerate.
The theoretical foundations provided here are valuable both because they provide
intuition about the determinants of saving targets, and because they make it easier
to develop reliable numerical solution methods (by providing necessary and sufficient
restrictions that solutions must satisfy).
The paper proceeds in three parts.
The first part articulates the conditions required for the problem to define a nondegenerate limiting consumption function, and explains how the paper’s model is more
general than models previously considered in the literature. The conditions required
for convergence are interestingly parallel to those required for the liquidity constrained
perfect foresight model; that parallel is explored and explained. Next, the paper derives
some limiting properties of the consumption function as cash approaches infinity and
as it approaches its lower bound; then the theorem is proven explaining when the
problem defines a contraction mapping. Finally, a related class of commonly-used models
(exemplified by Deaton (1991)) is shown to constitute a particular limit of this paper’s
model.
The next section examines five key properties of the model. First, as cash approaches
infinity the expected growth rate of consumption and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) converge to their values in the perfect foresight case. Second, as cash
approaches zero the expected growth rate of consumption approaches infinity, and the
MPC approaches a simple analytical limit. Third, if the consumer is ‘growth impatient,’
a unique target cash-to-permanent-income ratio will exist. Fourth, at the target cash
ratio, the expected growth rate of consumption is slightly less than the expected growth
rate of permanent (noncapital) income. Finally, the expected growth rate of consumption
is declining in the level of cash. The first four propositions are proven under general
assumptions about parameter values; the last is shown to hold if there are no transitory
shocks, but may fail in extreme cases if there are both transitory and permanent shocks.
Szeidl (2012) has shown that such an economy will be characterized by stable invariant
distributions for the consumption ratio, the wealth ratio, and other variables.2 Using
Szeidl’s result, the final section discusses conditions under which, even with a fixed
aggregate interest rate that differs from the time preference rate, an economy populated
by buffer stock consumers converges to a balanced growth equilibrium in which the

supportive simulation evidence.

income.

2 The Problem
2.1 Setup
The consumer solves a standard optimization problem from the current period t until
the end of life at T :

n=0

where
u(•) = •1−ρ /(1 − ρ)

(1)

is a constant relative risk aversion utility function with ρ > 1.3 , 4 The consumer’s
initial condition is defined by market resources mt (Deaton (1991)’s ‘cash-on-hand’)
and permanent noncapital income pt .
In the usual treatment, a dynamic budget constraint (DBC) incorporates several
different elements that determine next period’s m (given this period’s choices); but for
the detailed analysis here, it will be useful to disarticulate the steps so that individual
ingredients can be separately examined:
at = mt − ct
bt+1 = at R
pt+1 = pt Γψt+1
| {z }

(2)

≡Γt+1

mt+1 = bt+1 + pt+1 ξt+1 ,
where at indicates the consumer’s assets at the end of period t, which grow by a fixed
interest factor R = (1 + r) between periods,5 so that bt+1 is the consumer’s financial
(‘bank’) balances before next period’s consumption choice;6 mt+1 (‘market resources’ or
‘money’) is the sum of financial wealth bt+1 and noncapital income pt+1 ξt+1 (permanent
noncapital income pt+1 multiplied by a mean-one iid transitory income shock factor
ξt+1 ; future transitory shocks are assumed to satisfy Et [ξt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1). Permanent
noncapital income in period t + 1 is equal to its previous value, multiplied by a growth
factor Γ, modified by a mean-one iid shock ψt+1 , Et [ψt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1 satisfying
3 The main results also hold for logarithmic utility which is the limit as ρ → 1 but incorporating the logarithmic
special case in the proofs is cumbersome and therefore omitted.
4 We will define the infinite horizon solution as the limit of the finite horizon problem as the horizon T − t approaches
infinity.
5 See Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2018) for interesting new work that considers the case where capital returns are
stochastic and liquidity constraints exist. Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) examines implications of capital income risk
for the distribution of wealth.
6 Allowing a stochastic interest factor is straightforward but adds little insight.

permanent shocks).7 , 8
In future periods t + n ∀ n ≥ 1 there is a small probability ℘ that income will be zero

where θt+n is an iid mean-one random variable (Et [θt+n ] = 1 ∀ n > 0) with a distribution
satisfying θ ∈ [θ, θ̄] where 0 < θ ≤ 1 ≤ θ̄ < ∞ (degenerately θ = θ̄ = 1). (See Rabault
(2002) and Li and Stachurski (2014) for analyses of cases where the shock processes
have unbounded support). Call the cumulative distribution functions Fψ and Fθ (and
Fξ is derived trivially from (3) and Fθ ). Permanent income and cash start out strictly
positive, {pt , mt } ∈ (0, ∞), and as usual the consumer cannot die in debt, so
cT ≤ mT .

(4)

The model looks more special than it is. In particular, the assumption of a positive
probability of zero-income events may seem objectionable. However, it is easy to show
that a model with a nonzero minimum value of ξ (motivated, for example, by the
existence of unemployment insurance) can be redefined by capitalizing the present discounted value of minimum income into current market assets,9 analytically transforming
that model back into the model analyzed here. Also, the assumption of a positive point
mass (as opposed to positive density) for the worst realization of the transitory shock is
inessential, but simplifies the proofs and is a powerful aid to intuition.10
This model differs from Bewley’s (1977) classic formulation in several ways. The
CRRA utility function does not satisfy Bewley’s assumption that u(0) is well defined, or
that u0 (0) is well defined and finite; indeed, neither the value function nor the marginal
value function will be bounded. It differs from Schectman and Escudero (1977) in that
they impose liquidity constraints and positive minimum income. It differs from both
of these in that it permits permanent growth in income, and also permanent shocks to
income, which a large empirical literature finds are quantitatively important in micro
data11 and which since Friedman (1957) have been understood to be far more consequential for household welfare than are transitory fluctuations. It differs from Deaton (1991)
because liquidity constraints are absent; there are separate transitory and permanent
shocks (a la Muth (1960)); and the transitory shocks here can occasionally cause income
7 It is useful to emphasize that permanent noncapital income as defined here differs from what Deaton (1992) calls
permanent income (which is often adopted in the macro literature). Deaton defines permanent income as the amount
that a perfect foresight consumer could spend while leaving total (human and nonhuman) wealth constant. Relatedly, we
refer to mt as ‘cash-on-hand’ or ‘market resources’ rather than as wealth to avoid any confusion for readers accustomed
to thinking of the discounted value of future noncapital income as a part of wealth. The ‘market resources’ terminology
is motivated by the model’s assumption that human wealth cannot be capitalized, an implication of anti-slavery laws.

to reach zero.12 Finally, it differs from models found in Stokey et. al. (1989) because
neither liquidity constraints nor bounds on utility or marginal utility are imposed.13 , 14
The incorporation of permanent shocks rules out application of the tools of Matkowski
and Nowak (2011), who followed and corrected an error in the fundamental work on
the local contraction mapping method developed in Rincón-Zapatero and RodríguezPalmero (2003). Martins-da Rocha and Vailakis (2010) provides a correction to RincónZapatero and Rodríguez-Palmero (2003), and provides conditions that are easier to
verify, but again only addresses the deterministic case.

2.2 The Problem Can Be Rewritten in Ratio Form
We establish a bit more notation by reviewing the standard result that in problems of this
class (CRRA utility, permanent shocks) the number of relevant state variables can be
reduced from two (m and p) to one (m = m/p). Generically defining nonbold variables
as the boldface counterpart normalized by pt (as with m in the previous sentence),
assume that value in the last period of life is u(mT ), and consider the problem in the
second-to-last period,
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = max u(cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(mT )]
cT −1

= max u(pT −1 cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(pT mT )]

= pT −1 max u(cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(ΓT mT )] ,
cT −1

(5)

where the last line follows because for the CRRA utility function (1), u(xy) = x1−ρ u(y).
Now, in a one-time deviation from the notational convention established in the last
paragraph, define nonbold ‘normalized value’ not as vt /pt but as vt = vt /p1−ρ
, because

it will become clear that the Deaton model is a particular limit of this paper’s model.
restrictions to those in the cited literature are made in the well known papers by Scheinkman and Weiss (1986)
and Clarida (1987). See Toche (2005) for an elegant analysis of a related but simpler continuous-time model.
14 Alvarez and Stokey (1998) relaxed the bounds on the return function, but they address only the deterministic case.

Since vT (mT ) = u(mT ), defining vT −1 (mT −1 ) from (6), we obtain
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = pT1−ρ
−1 vT −1 (mT −1 /pT −1 ).

This logic induces to all earlier periods, so that if we solve the normalized one-statevariable problem (6), we will have solutions to the original problem for any t < T from:
vt (mt , pt ) = pt1−ρ vt (mt ),
ct (mt , pt ) = pt ct (mt ).

2.3 Definition of a Nondegenerate Solution
We say that this problem has a nondegenerate solution if, as the number of remaining
periods of life gets arbitrarily large, the backward-iterating solution defines a unique
limiting consumption function c(•) that satisfies
(8)

0 < c(m) < ∞

for every 0 < m < ∞. (‘Degenerate’ limits will be cases where the limiting consumption
function is c(m) = 0 or c(m) = ∞.)

2.4 Perfect Foresight Benchmarks
The familiar analytical solution to the perfect foresight specialization of the model,
obtained by setting ℘ = 0 and θ = θ̄ = ψ = ψ̄ = 1, allows us to define some remaining
notation and terminology, providing a convenient reference point.
2.4.1 Human Wealth
The dynamic budget constraint, strictly positive marginal utility, and the can’t-die-indebt condition (4) imply an exactly-holding intertemporal budget constraint (IBC):

PDVt (c) = mt − pt + PDVt (p),

where b is nonhuman wealth and ht is ‘human wealth,’ and with a constant R ≡ R/Γ,

This equation makes plain that in order for h ≡ limn→∞ hT −n to be finite, we must
impose the Finite Human Wealth Condition (‘FHWC’):
Γ/R < 1.
|{z}

≡R−1

7

(12)

Intuitively, for human wealth to be finite, the growth rate of (noncapital) income must
be smaller than the interest rate at which that income is being discounted.
2.4.2 Unconstrained Solution
The consumption Euler equation holds in every period; with u0 (c) = c−ρ ,
ct+1 /ct = (Rβ)1/ρ ≡ Þ

(13)

Þ < 1,

(14)

Þ R ≡ Þ /R

(15)

where the Old English letter ‘thorn’ represents what we will call the ‘absolute patience
factor’ (Rβ)1/ρ .15 The sense in which Þ captures patience is that if the ‘absolute
impatience condition’ (AIC) holds,
the consumer will choose to spend an amount too large to sustain indefinitely (the level
of consumption must fall over time). We call such a consumer ‘absolutely impatient’
(the key condition in Bewley (1977)).
We next define a ‘return patience factor’ that relates absolute patience to the return
factor:
and since consumption is growing by Þ but discounted by R:

(18)

where κt is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) because it answers the question
‘if the consumer had an extra unit of wealth, how much more would be spent.’ (The
overbar on c reflects the fact that this will be an upper bound as we modify the problem
to incorporate constraints and uncertainty; analogously, the underbar for κ indicates
that it is a lower bound). Equation (17) makes plain that for the limiting MPC to be
strictly positive as n = T − t goes to infinity we must impose the Return Impatience
15 Impatience conditions of one kind or another have figured in intertemporal optimization problems since such problems
were first formalized in economics, most notably by Ramsey (1928). Discussion of these issues was prominent in the
literature of the 1960s and 1970s, and no brief citations here could do justice to the literature on the topic, so I refrain
from the attempt.

Condition (RIC):
(19)

Þ R < 1,

so that

0 < κ ≡ 1 − Þ R = lim κT −n .

(20)

c̄(m) = (m + h − 1)κ,

(21)

vt = u(ct ) + βu(ctÞ ) + β 2 u(ctÞ 2 ) + ...

(22)

n→∞

The RIC thus imposes a second kind of ‘impatience:’ The consumer cannot be so
pathologically patient as to wish, in the limit as the horizon approaches infinity, to
spend nothing today out of an increase in current wealth; that is, the condition rules
out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = 0. Because the return patience factor Þ R
is the absolute patience factor divided by the return, we call equation (19) the ‘return
impatience condition’ or RIC; we will say that a consumer who satisfies the condition is
‘return impatient.’
Given that the RIC holds, and defining limiting objects by the absence of a time
subscript (e.g., c̄(m) = limn↑∞ c̄T −n (m)), the limiting consumption function will be
and we now see that in order to rule out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = ∞ we
need h to be finite; that is, we must impose the finite human wealth condition (12).
A final useful point is that since the perfect foresight growth factor for consumption
is Þ , u(xy) = x1−ρ u(y) yields an analytical expression for value:

Þ1−ρ < 1;16 with
which asymptotes to a finite number as n = T − t approaches +∞ if βÞ
a bit of algebra,17 this requirement can be shown to be equivalent to the RIC. Thus,
the same conditions that guarantee a nondegenerate limiting consumption function also
guarantee a nondegenerate limiting value function (which, interestingly, will not be true
in the version of the model below that incorporates uncertainty).
2.4.3 Constrained Solution
If a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0 is ever to be relevant, it must be relevant at
the lowest possible level of market resources, mt = 1, which obtains for a consumer who
enters period t with bt = 0. The constraint is ‘relevant’ if it prevents the choice that

would otherwise be optimal; at mt = 1 the constraint is relevant if the marginal utility
from spending all of today’s resources ct = mt = 1, exceeds the marginal utility from
doing the same thing next period, ct+1 = 1; that is, if such choices would violate the
Euler equation (7):
1−ρ > Rβ(Γ)−ρ 1−ρ .

(23)

By analogy to the return patience factor, we therefore define a ‘perfect foresight growth
patience factor’ (PF-GPF) as
Þ Γ = Þ /Γ,

(24)

ÞΓ < 1

(25)

and define a ‘perfect foresight growth impatience condition’ (PF-GIC)
which is equivalent to (23) (exponentiate both sides by 1/ρ).
If the RIC (19) and the FHWC (12) hold, appendix A shows that, for some 0 < m# <
1, an unconstrained consumer behaving according to (21) would choose c < m for all
m > m# . The solution to the constrained consumer’s problem in this case is simple:
For any m ≥ m# the constraint does not bind (and will never bind in the future) so the
constrained consumption function is identical to the unconstrained one. If the consumer
were somehow18 to arrive at an m < m# < 1 the constraint would bind and the consumer
would have to consume c = m. We use the ◦ accent to designate the limiting constrained
consumption function:
(
m
if m < m#
c̊(m) =
(26)
c̄(m) if m ≥ m# .

More useful is the case where the perfect foresight growth and return impatience
conditions both hold. In this case appendix A shows that the limiting constrained
consumption function is piecewise linear, with c̊(m) = m up to a first ‘kink point’ at
m1# > 1, and with discrete declines in the MPC at a set of kink points {m1# , m2# , ...}.
As m ↑ ∞ the constrained consumption function c̊(m) becomes arbitrarily close to the
κ(m) ≡ c̊0 (m)
unconstrained c̄(m), and the marginal propensity to consume function κ̊
limits to κ. Similarly, the value function v̊(m) is nondegenerate and limits into the
value function of the unconstrained consumer. This logic holds even when the finite

amount of resources bt > 1 will, over time, run those resources down so that by some

(that is, for n > 0). The consumer’s value function is therefore nondegenerate.
The most peculiar possibility occurs when the RIC fails. Under these circumstances
the FHWC must also fail (Appendix A), and the constrained consumption function
is nondegenerate. (See Figure 8 for a numerical example). While it is true that

2.5 Uncertainty-Modified Conditions
2.5.1 Impatience
When uncertainty is introduced, the expectation of bt+1 can be rewritten as:
−1
Et [bt+1 ] = at Et [Rt+1 ] = at R Et [ψt+1
]

(28)

where Jensen’s inequality guarantees that the expectation of the inverse of the permanent
shock is strictly greater than one. It will be convenient to define the object
ψ ≡ (E[ψ −1 ])−1

because this permits us to write expressions like the RHS of (28) compactly as, e.g.,
at R/ψ −1 .19 We refer to this as the ‘compensated return,’ because it compensates (in a
risk-neutral way) for the effect of uncertainty on the expected growth-normalized return
(in the sense implicitly defined in (28)).
We can now transparently generalize the PF-GIC (25) by defining a ‘compensated
growth factor’
Γ = Γψ

(29)

and a compensated Growth Patience Pactor (GPF):
Þ Γ = Þ /Γ
 
Þ
=E
Γψ

(30)

and a straightforward derivation ((44) below) yields the conclusion that
lim Et [mt+1 /mt ] = Þ Γ ,

mt →∞

19 One way to think of ψ is as a particular kind of a ‘certainty equivalent’ of the shock; this captures the intuition that
mean-one shock renders a given mean level of income less valuable than if the shock did not exist, so that ψ < 1.

12

which implies that if we wish to prevent m from heading to infinity (that is, if we want
m to be expected to fall for some large enough value of m) we must impose a generalized
version of the Perfect Foresight Growth Impatience Condition (25); we call the ‘growth
impatience condition’ (GIC) the requirement that the Growth Patience Factor must be
less than 1:20
(31)

ÞΓ < 1

which is stronger than the perfect foresight version (25) because Γ < Γ (Jensen’s
inequality implies that ψ < 1 for nondegenerate ψ).
2.5.2 Autarky Value
Analogously to (22), a consumer who spent exactly their permanent income every period
would have value determined by the product of the expectation of the (independent)
future shocks to permanent income:


vt = Et u(pt ) + βu(pt Γt+1 ) + ... + β T −t u(pt Γt+1 ...ΓT )


1 − (βΓ1−ρ E[ψ 1−ρ ])T −t+1

1 − βΓ1−ρ E[ψ 1−ρ ]

which invites the definition of a utility-compensated equivalent of the permanent shock,
ψ = (E[ψ 1−ρ ])1/(1−ρ)

which will satisfy ψ < 1 for ρ > 1 and nondegenerate ψ (and ψ < ψ for the reasonable
(though not required) case of ρ > 2); defining
(32)

Γ = Γψ
we can see that vt will be finite as T approaches ∞ if

βΓ1−ρ < 1

(33)

β < Γρ−1
which we call the ‘finite value of autarky’ condition (FVAC) because it guarantees that
value is finite for a consumer who always consumes their (now stochastic) permanent
income. For nondegenerate ψ, this condition is stronger (harder to satisfy in the sense
of requiring lower β) than the perfect foresight version (27) because Γ < Γ.21
20 Equation

(31) is a bit easier to satisfy than the similar condition imposed by Deaton (1991):

2.6 The Baseline Numerical Solution
Figure 3 depicts the successive consumption rules that apply in the last period of
life (cT (m)), the second-to-last period, and various earlier periods under the baseline
parameter values listed in Table 2. (The 45 degree line is labelled as cT (m) = m because
in the last period of life it is optimal to spend all remaining resources.)
In the figure, the consumption rules appear to converge as the horizon recedes (our
purpose is to show that this appearance is not deceptive); we call the limiting infinitehorizon consumption rule
c(m) ≡ lim cT −n (m).
n→∞

(34)

2.7 Concave Consumption Function Characteristics
A precondition for the main proof is that the maximization problem (6) defines a
sequence of continuously differentiable strictly increasing strictly concave22 functions
{cT , cT −1 , ...}.23 The straightforward but tedious proof is relegated to appendix B. For
present purposes, the most important point is the following intuition: ct (m) < m for
all periods t < T because a consumer who spent all available resources would arrive in
period t + 1 with balances bt+1 of zero, and then might earn zero noncapital income over
the remaining horizon (an unbroken series of zero-income events is unlikely but possible).
In such a case, the budget constraint and the can’t-die-in-debt condition mean that the
consumer would be forced to spend zero, incurring negative infinite utility. To avoid

where the last equation is the same as the PF-FVAC condition except that the RHS is multiplied by ψ 1−1/ρ which is
strictly less than 1.
22 There is one obvious exception: c (m) is a linear (and so only weakly concave) function.

this disaster, the consumer never spends everything. (This is an example of the ‘natural
borrowing constraint’ induced by a precautionary motive, per Zeldes (1989)).24

2.8 Bounds for the Consumption Functions
The consumption functions depicted in Figure 3 appear to have limiting slopes as m ↓ 0
and as m ↑ ∞. This section confirms that impression and derives those slopes, which
also turn out to be useful in the contraction mapping proof.25 , 26
Assume (as discussed above) that a continuously differentiable concave consumption
function exists in period t + 1, with an origin at ct+1 (0) = 0, a minimal MPC κt+1 > 0,
and maximal MPC κ̄t+1 ≤ 1. (If t + 1 = T these will be κT = κ̄T = 1; for earlier periods
they will exist by recursion from the following arguments.)
The MPC bound as wealth approaches infinity is easy to understand: In this case, under our imposed assumption that human wealth is finite, the proportion of consumption
that will be financed out of human wealth approaches zero. The consequence is that
the proportional difference between the solution to the model with uncertainty and the
perfect foresight model shrinks to zero.
In the course of proving this, appendix F provides a recursive expression for the
(inverse of the) limiting MPC:
−1
κ−1
t = 1 + Þ R κt+1 .

(35)

2.8.1 Weak RIC Conditions

a condition that we dub the ‘Weak Return Impatience Condition’ (WRIC) because with
ÞR < 1).
℘ < 1 it will hold more easily (for a larger set of parameter values) than the RIC (Þ
The essence of the argument is that as wealth approaches zero, the overriding consideration that limits consumption is the (recursive) fear of the zero income events.
(That consideration is why the probability of the zero income event ℘ appears in the
expression.)
24 It would perhaps be better to call it the ‘utility-induced borrowing constraint’ as it follows from the assumptions on
the utility function (in particular, limc↓0 u(c) = −∞); for example, no such constraint arises if utility is of the (implausible)
Constant Absolute Risk Aversion form.
25 Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) show that the consumption function becomes linear as wealth approaches infinity
in a model with capital income risk and liquidity constraints; their results should generalize to the limits derived here if
capital income risk were added to the model.
26 Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2020) establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general income fluctuation
problem with capital income risk in a Markovian setting and use such a model to study the tail behavior of wealth in the
presence of risky returns to capital.

17

We are now in position to observe that the optimal consumption function must satisfy
κt mt ≤ct (mt ) ≤ κ̄t mt

(38)

because consumption starts at zero and is continuously differentiable (as argued above),
is strictly concave (Carroll and Kimball (1996)), and always exhibits a slope between κt
and κ̄t (the formal proof is provided in appendix D).
These limits are useful at least in the sense that they can be hard-wired into a solution
algorithm for the model, which has the potential to make the solution more efficient (cf.
Carroll, Chipeniuk, Tokuoka, and Wu (2020)). Alternatively, they can provide a useful
check on the accuracy of a solution algorithm that does not impose them directly.

2.9 Conditions Under Which the Problem Defines a Contraction Mapping
To prove that the consumption rules converge, we need to show that the problem defines
a contraction mapping. This cannot be proven using the standard theorems in, say,
Stokey et. al. (1989), which require marginal utility to be bounded over the space of
possible values of m, because the possibility (however unlikely) of an unbroken string
of zero-income events for the remainder of life means that as m approaches zero c must
approach zero (see the discussion in 2.7); thus, marginal utility is unbounded. Although a
recent literature examines the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Bellman equations
in the presence of ‘unbounded returns’ (see, e.g., Matkowski and Nowak (2011)), the
techniques in that literature cannot be used to solve the problem here because the
required conditions are violated by a problem that involves permanent shocks.27
Fortunately, Boyd (1990) provided a weighted contraction mapping theorem that
Alvarez and Stokey (1998) showed could be used to address the homogeneous case (of
which CRRA formulation is an example) in a deterministic framework; later, Durán
(2003) showed how to extend the Boyd (1990) approach to the stochastic case.
Definition 1. Consider any function • ∈ C(A, B) where C(A, B) is the space of continuous functions from A to B. Suppose z ∈ C(A, B) with B ⊆ R and z > 0. Then • is
z-bounded if the z-norm of •,


| • (m)|
,
(39)
k • kz = sup
z(m)
m
is finite.
For Cz (A, B) defined as the set of functions in C(A, B) that are z-bounded; w, x, y,
and z as examples of z-bounded functions; and using 0(m) = 0 to indicate the function
that returns zero for any argument, Boyd (1990) proves the following.

27 See Yao (2012) for a detailed discussion of the reasons the existing literature up through Matkowski and Nowak
(2011) cannot handle the problem described here.

such that 28 , 29
(1)T is non-decreasing, i.e. x ≤ y ⇒ {Tx} ≤ {Ty}
(2){T0} ∈ Cz (A, B)
(3)There exists some real 0 < α < 1, such that
{T(w + ζz)} ≤ {Tw} + ζαz holds for all real ζ > 0 .
Then T defines a contraction with a unique fixed point.

Using this, we introduce the mapping T : Cz (A, B) → C (A, B),30
{Tz}(mt ) =

ct ∈[κmt ,κ̄mt ]

u(ct ) + β ({Ez}(mt − ct )) .

(40)

We can show that our operator T satisfies the conditions that Boyd requires of
his operator T, if we impose two restrictions on parameter values. The first is the
WRIC necessary for convergence of the maximal MPC, equation (37) above. A more
serious restriction is the utility-compensated Finite Value of Autarky condition, equation
(33). (We discuss the interpretation of these restrictions in detail in section 2.11 below.)
Imposing these restrictions, we are now in position to state the central theorem of the
paper.
Theorem 1. T is a contraction mapping if the restrictions on parameter values (37)
and (33) are true (that is, if the weak return impatience condition and the finite value
of autarky condition hold).
Intuitively, Boyd’s theorem shows that if you can find a z that is everywhere finite
but goes to infinity ‘as fast or faster’ than the function you are normalizing with z,
the normalized problem defines a contraction mapping. The intuition for the FVAC
condition is just that, with an infinite horizon, with any initial amount of bank balances
b0 , in the limit your value can always be made greater than you would get by consuming
exactly your permanent income every period (say, by consuming (r/R)b0 −  for some
small  > 0).
The details of the proof are cumbersome, and are therefore relegated to appendix D.
Given that the value function converges, appendix D.3 shows that the consumption
functions converge.

28 We

will usually denote the function that results from the mapping as, e.g., {Tw}.
non-theorists, this notation may be slightly confusing; the inequality relations in (1) and (3) are taken to mean
‘for any specific element • in the domain of the functions in question’ so that, e.g., x ≤ y is short for x(•) ≤ y(•) ∀ • ∈ A.
In this notation, ζαz in (3) is a function which can be applied to any argument • (because z is a function).
30 Note that the existence of the maximum is assured by the continuity of {Ez}(a ) (it is continuous because it is the
t
sum of continuous z-bounded functions z) and the compactness of [κmt , κ̄mt ].

2.10 The Liquidity Constrained Solution as a Limit
This section shows that a related problem commonly considered in the literature (e.g.,
with a simpler income process, by Deaton (1991)), with a liquidity constraint and a
positive minimum value of income, is the limit of the problem considered here as the
probability ℘ of the zero-income event approaches zero.
The essence of the argument is easy to state. As noted above, there is a finite
possibility of earning zero income over the remainder of the horizon, which prevents
the consumer from ending the current period with zero assets because with some finite
probability the consumer would be forced to consume zero, which would be infinitely
painful.
But the extent to which the consumer feels the need to make this precautionary
provision depends on the probability that it will turn out to matter. As ℘ ↓ 0, that
probability becomes arbitrarily small, so the amount of precautionary saving approaches
zero. But zero precautionary saving is the amount of saving that a liquidity constrained
consumer with perfect foresight would choose.
Another way to think about this is just to think of the liquidity constraint as being
imposed by specifying a component of the utility function that is zero whenever the
consumer ends the period with (strictly) positive assets, but negative infinity if the
consumer ended the period with (weakly) negative assets.
See appendix G for the formal proof justifying the foregoing intuitive discussion.

2.11 Discussion of Parametric Restrictions
The full relationship among all the conditions articulated above is represented in (??).
Though the diagram looks complex, it is merely a modified version of the earlier diagram
with further (mostly intermediate) inequalities inserted. Again readers unfamiliar with
such diagrams should Appendix ) for a more detailed explanation.
2.11.1 The RIC
In the perfect foresight unconstrained problem (section 2.4.2), the RIC was required for
existence of a nondegenerate solution. It is surprising, therefore, that in the presence
of uncertainty, the RIC is neither necessary nor sufficient for a nondegenerate solution.
We thus begin our discussion by asking what features the problem must exhibit (given
the FVAC) if the RIC fails (that is, R < (Rβ)1/ρ ):

but since ψ < 1 and 0 < 1 − 1/ρ < 1 (because we have assumed ρ > 1), this
can hold only if R/Γ < 1; that is, given the FVAC, the RIC can fail only if human
wealth is unbounded. Unbounded human wealth is permitted here, as in the perfect


foresight liquidity constrained problem. But, from equation (35), an implication of 
RIC
0
is that limm↑∞ c (m) = 0. Thus, interestingly, the presence of uncertainty both permits
unlimited human wealth and at the same time prevents that unlimited wealth from
resulting in infinite consumption. That is, in the presence of uncertainty, pathological
patience (which in the perfect foresight model with finite wealth results in consumption
of zero) plus infinite human wealth (which the perfect foresight model rules out because
it leads to infinite consumption) combine here to yield a unique finite limiting MPC for
any finite value of m. Note the close parallel to the conclusion in the perfect foresight
 case (for detailed analysis of this case

liquidity constrained model in the {PF-GIC,
RIC}
see appendix A). There, too, the tension between infinite human wealth and pathological
patience was resolved with a nondegenerate consumption function whose limiting MPC
was zero.
2.11.2 The WRIC
The ‘weakness’ of the additional requirement for contraction, the weak RIC, can be
seen by asking ‘under what circumstances would the FVAC hold but the WRIC fail?’
Algebraically, the requirement is
βΓ1−ρ ψ 1−ρ < 1 < (℘β)1/ρ /R1−1/ρ .

(42)

If there were no conceivable parameter values that could satisfy both of these inequal-

21

ities, the WRIC would have no force; it would be redundant. And if we require R ≥ 1,
the WRIC is indeed redundant because now β < 1 < Rρ−1 , so that the RIC (and WRIC)
must hold.
But neither theory nor evidence demands that we assume R ≥ 1. We can therefore
approach the question of the WRIC’s relevance by asking just how low R must be for the
condition to be relevant. Suppose for illustration that ρ = 2, ψ 1−ρ = 1.01, Γ1−ρ = 1.01−1
and ℘ = 0.10. In that case (42) reduces to
β < 1 < (0.1β/R)1/2
but since β < 1 by assumption, the binding requirement is that
R < β/10
so that for example if β = 0.96 we would need R < 0.096 (that is, a perpetual riskfree
rate of return of worse than -90 percent a year) in order for the WRIC to bind. The
relevance of the WRIC is indeed “Weak.”
Perhaps the best way of thinking about this is to note that the space of parameter
values for which the WRIC is relevant shrinks out of existence as ℘ → 0, which section
2.10 showed was the precise limiting condition under which behavior becomes arbitrarily
close to the liquidity constrained solution (in the absence of other risks). On the other
hand, when ℘ = 1, the consumer has no noncapital income (so that the FHWC holds)
and with ℘ = 1 the WRIC is identical to the RIC; but the RIC is the only condition
required for a solution to exist for a perfect foresight consumer with no noncapital
income. Thus the WRIC forms a sort of ‘bridge’ between the liquidity constrained and
the unconstrained problems as ℘ moves from 0 to 1.
2.11.3 When the GIC Fails
If both the GIC and the RIC hold, the arguments above establish that the limiting
consumption function asymptotes to the consumption function for the perfect foresight
unconstrained function. The more interesting case is where the GIC fails. A solution
 is depicted in Figure 4. The consumption

that satisfies the combination FVAC and 
GIC
function is shown along with the Et [∆mt+1 ] = 0 locus that identifies the ‘sustainable’
level of spending at which m is expected to remain unchanged. The diagram suggests a
fact that is confirmed by deeper analysis: Under the depicted configuration of parameter
values (see the code for details), the consumption function never reaches the Et [∆mt+1 ] =
0 locus; indeed, when the RIC holds but the GIC does not, the consumption function’s
limiting slope (1 − Þ /R) is shallower than that of the sustainable consumption locus
(1 − Γ/R),31 so the gap between the two actually increases with m in the limit. Although
a nondegenerate consumption function exists, a target level of m does not (or, rather, the
target is m = ∞), because no matter how wealthy a consumer becomes, the consumer
will always spend less than the amount that would keep m stable (in expectation).
For the reader’s convenience, Tables 3 and 4 present a summary of the connections
between the various conditions in the presence and the absence of uncertainty.

is because Et [mt+1 ] = Et [Rt+1 (mt − ct )] + 1; solve m = (m − c)Rψ −1 + 1 for c and differentiate.

3 Analysis of the Converged Consumption Function
Figures 5 and 6a,b capture the main properties of the converged consumption rule when
the RIC, GIC, and FHWC all hold.32 Figure 5 shows the expected consumption growth
factor Et [ct+1 /ct ] for a consumer behaving according to the converged consumption rule,
while Figures 6a,b illustrate theoretical bounds for the consumption function and the
marginal propensity to consume.
Five features of behavior are captured, or suggested, by the figures. First, as mt ↑ ∞
the expected consumption growth factor goes to Þ , indicated by the lower bound in
Figure 5, and the marginal propensity to consume approaches κ = (1 − Þ R ) (Figure 6),
the same as the perfect foresight MPC.33 Second, as mt ↓ 0 the consumption growth
factor approaches ∞ (Figure 5) and the MPC approaches κ̄ = (1 − ℘1/ρÞ R ) (Figure 6).
Third (Figure 5), there is a target cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ such that if mt = m̌
then Et [mt+1 ] = mt , and (as indicated by the arrows of motion on the Et [ct+1 /ct ] curve),
the model’s dynamics are ‘stable’ around the target in the sense that if mt < m̌ then
cash-on-hand will rise (in expectation), while if mt > m̌, it will fall (in expectation).
Fourth (Figure 5), at the target m, the expected rate of growth of consumption is
slightly less than the expected growth rate of permanent noncapital income. The final
proposition suggested by Figure 5 is that the expected consumption growth factor is
declining in the level of the cash-on-hand ratio mt . This turns out to be true in the
absence of permanent shocks, but in extreme cases it can be false if permanent shocks
are present.34

3.1 Limits as mt ↑ ∞
Define

c(m) = κm
which is the solution to an infinite-horizon problem with no noncapital income (ξt+n =
0 ∀ n ≥ 1); clearly c(m) < c(m), since allowing the possibility of future noncapital
income cannot reduce current consumption.35
Assuming the FHWC holds, the infinite horizon perfect foresight solution (21) constitutes an upper bound on consumption in the presence of uncertainty, since Carroll and
Kimball (1996) show that the introduction of uncertainty strictly decreases the level of
consumption at any m.

32 These

figures reflect the converged rule corresponding to the parameter values indicated in Table 2.
the RIC fails, the limiting minimal MPC is 0; see appendix.
34 Throughout the remaining analysis I make a final assumption that is not strictly justified by the foregoing. We have
seen that the finite-horizon consumption functions cT −n (m) are twice continuously differentiable and strictly concave,
and that they converge to a continuous function c(m). It does not strictly follow that the limiting function c(m) is twice
continuously differentiable, but I will assume that it is.
35 We will assume the RIC holds here and subsequently so that κ > 0; the situation is a bit more complex when the
RIC does not hold. In that case the bound on consumption is given by the spending that would be undertaken by a
consumer who faced binding liquidity constraints. Detailed analysis of this special case is not sufficiently interesting to
warrant inclusion in the paper.

This argument applies equally well to the problem of the restrained consumer, because
as m approaches infinity the constraint becomes irrelevant (assuming the FHWC holds).

3.2 Limits as mt ↓ 0

Now consider the limits of behavior as mt gets arbitrarily small.
Equation (36) shows that the limiting value of κ̄ is
κ̄ = 1 − R−1 (℘Rβ)1/ρ .

Defining e(m) = c(m)/m as before we have

lim e(m) = (1 − ℘1/ρÞ R ) = κ̄.

L’Hôpital’s rule, we have
lim c0 (m) = lim e(m) = κ̄.

3.3 There Exists Exactly One Target Cash-on-Hand Ratio, which is Stable
We now prove the existence of a target cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ towards which
an agent’s m expects to move. (The ∨ accent is meant to invoke the fact that this is the
value that other m’s ‘point to.’) We state the necessary conditions for the existence of
m̌ and its properties in the following theorem.

37 The

same arguments establish limm↓0 Et [ct+1 /ct ] = ∞ for the problem of the restrained consumer.

28

Theorem 2. For the problem defined in section 2.1, if the GIC (31), and WRIC (37),
then there exists a unique cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ > 0 such that
Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1 if mt = m̌.

(46)

Moreover, m̌ is stable in the sense that
∀mt ∈ (0, m̌), Et [mt+1 ] > mt
∀mt ∈ (m̌, ∞), Et [mt+1 ] < mt .

(47)

The elements of the proof are:

• Existence and continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ]
• Existence of a point where Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
• Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing
3.3.1 Existence and Continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ].
The consumption function exists because we have imposed the conditions (the WRIC and
FVAC) that theorem 1 establishes are sufficient for its existence. (Indeed, Appendix C
shows that c(m) is not just continuous, but twice continuously differentiable.)
Section 2.7 shows that for all t, at−1 = mt−1 − ct−1 > 0. Since mt = at−1 Rt + yt , even
if yt takes on its minimum value of 0, at−1 Rt > 0, since both at−1 and Rt are strictly
positive under our foregoing assumptions. With mt > 0, the ratio Et [mt+1 /mt ] inherits
continuity (and, for that matter, continuous differentiability) from the consumption
function.
3.3.2 Existence of a point where Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1.
Section 3.2 shows that limmt ↓0 Et [mt+1 /mt ] = ∞, while the limit as mt goes to infinity

The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if Et [mt+1 /mt ] is continuous, and takes
on values above and below 1, there must be at least one point at which it is equal to
one.
3.3.3 Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing.

Now define ζ (mt ) ≡ Et [mt+1 ] − mt and note that

ζ (mt ) < 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] < 1
29

ζ (mt ) = 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
ζ (mt ) > 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] > 1,

(49)

so that ζ (m̌) = 0. Our goal is to prove that ζ (•) is strictly decreasing on (0, ∞) using
the fact that

The foregoing arguments rely on the continuous differentiability of c(m), so the
arguments do not directly go through for the restrained consumer’s problem in which
the existence of liquidity constraints can lead to discrete changes in the slope c0 (m) at
particular values of m. But we can use the fact that the restrained model is the limit
of the baseline model as ℘ ↓ 0 to conclude that there is likely a unique target cash level
even in the restrained model.
If consumers are sufficiently impatient, the limiting target level in the restrained model
will be m̌ = Et [ξt+1 ] = 1. That is, if a consumer starting with m = 1 will save nothing,
a(1) = 0, then the target level of m in the restrained model will be 1; if a consumer
with m = 1 would choose to save something, then the target level of cash-on-hand will
be greater than the expected level of income.

3.4 Expected Consumption Growth at Target m Is Less than Expected
Permanent Income Growth
In Figure 5 the intersection of the target cash-on-hand ratio locus at m̌ with the
expected consumption growth curve lies below the intersection with the horizontal line
representing the growth rate of expected permanent income. This can be proven as
follows.
Strict concavity of the consumption function implies that if Et [mt+1 ] = m̌ = mt then

which implies that the entire term added to Γ in (52) is negative, as required.

3.5 Expected Consumption Growth Is a Declining Function of mt (or Is
It?)
Figure 5 depicts the expected consumption growth factor as a strictly declining function
of the cash-on-hand ratio. To investigate this, define
Υ (mt ) ≡ Γt+1 c(Rt+1 a(mt ) + ξt+1 )/c(mt ) = ct+1 /ct

and the proposition in which we are interested is

Henceforth indicating appropriate arguments by the corresponding subscript (e.g.
c0t+1 ≡ c0 (mt+1 )), since Γt+1 Rt+1 = R, the portion of the LHS of equation (53) in
brackets can be manipulated to yield
ctΥ 0t+1 = c0t+1 a0t R − c0t Γt+1 ct+1 /ct
= c0t+1 a0t R − c0tΥ t+1 .

The latter proposition is obviously true under our assumption ρ > 1. The former will
be true if

covt (Γψt+1 c(mt+1 ))−ρ−1 , c0 (mt+1 ) > 0.
The two shocks cause two kinds of variation in mt+1 . Variations due to ξt+1 satisfy
the proposition, since a higher draw of ξ both reduces c−ρ−1
and reduces the marginal
t+1
propensity to consume. However, permanent shocks have conflicting effects. On the one
hand, a higher draw of ψt+1 will reduce mt+1 , thus increasing both c−ρ−1
and c0t+1 . On
t+1
the other hand, the c−ρ−1
term is multiplied by Γψt+1 , so the effect of a higher ψt+1
t+1
could be to decrease the first term in the covariance, leading to a negative covariance
with the second term. (Analogously, a lower permanent shock ψt+1 can also lead a
negative correlation.)

32

perverse effect dominates. However, extreme assumptions were required (in particular,
a very small probability of the zero-income shock) and the region in which Υ 0t+1 > 0 was

4 The Aggregate and Idiosyncratic Relationship
Between Consumption Growth and Income Growth
This section examines the behavior of large collections of buffer-stock consumers with
identical parameter values. Such a collection can be thought of as either a subset of the
population within a single country (say, members of a given education or occupation
group), or as the whole population in a small open economy.39
Formally, we assume a continuum of ex ante identical households on the unit interval,
with constant total mass normalized to one and indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], all behaving
according to the model specified above.40
Szeidl (2012) proves that such a population will be characterized by an invariant
distribution of m that induces invariant distributions for c and a; designate these F m ,
F a , and F c .41

4.1 Consumption and Income Growth at the Household Level
It is useful to define the operator M [•] which yields the mean value of its argument in
the population, as distinct from the expectations operator E [•] which represents beliefs
about the future.
An economist with a microeconomic dataset could calculate the average growth rate
of idiosyncratic consumption, and would find
M [∆ log ct+1 ] = M [log ct+1 pt+1 − log ct pt ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt + log ct+1 − log ct ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt ] + M [log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2) + M[log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2)

where γ = log Γ and the last equality follows because the invariance of F c (see Szeidl
(2012)) means that M [log ct+n ] = M [log ct ].42
39 We will continue to take the aggregate interest rate as exogenous and constant. It is also possible, and only slightly
more difficult, to solve for the steady-state of a closed-economy version of the model where the interest rate is endogenous.
40 One inconvenient aspect of the model as specified is that it does not exhibit a stationary distribution of idiosyncratic
permanent noncapital income; the longer the economy lasts, the wider is the distribution. This problem can be remedied
by assuming a constant probability of death, and replacing deceased households with newborns whose initial idiosyncratic
permanent income matches the mean idiosyncratic permanent income of the population. For a fully worked-out general
equilibrium version of such a model, see Carroll, Slacalek, and Tokuoka (2015).
41 Szeidl’s proof supplants simulation evidence of ergodicity that appeared in an earlier version of this paper.
42 Papers in the simulation literature have observed an approximate equivalence between the average growth rates of
idiosyncratic consumption and permanent income, but formal proof was not possible until Szeidl’s proof of ergodicity.

33

Thus, in a population that has reached its invariant distribution, the growth rate of
idiosyncratic log consumption matches the growth rate of idiosyncratic log permanent
income.

4.2 Growth Rates of Aggregate Income and Consumption
Attanasio and Weber (1995) point out that concavity of the consumption function (or
other nonlinearities) can imply that it is quantitatively important to distinguish between
the growth rate of average consumption and the average growth rate of consumption.43
We have just examined the average growth rate; we now examine the growth rate of the
average.
Using boldface capital letters for aggregate variables, the growth factor for aggregate
income is given by:
Yt+1 /Yt = M [ξt+1 Γψt+1 pt ] /M [pt ξt ]
=Γ
because of the independence assumptions we have made about ξ and ψ.
The growth factor for aggregate assets is:





where the second-to-last line follows from Szeidl (2012)’s proof the ergodicity of the
distributions of normalized variables for this problem, which implies that M[at+1 − at ] =
0.
Unfortunately, it is clear that the covariance term in the numerator, while generally
small, will not in general be zero. This is because the realization of the permanent shock
ψt+1 has a nonlinear effect on at+1 .
43 Since

we assume number of the households are normalized to 1, aggregate and average variables are identical.

34

One way of thinking about this is that it reflects the fact that, under our assumptions,
the p variable does not have an ergodic distribution; the distribution of permanent
income becomes forever wider and wider as time progress in this model.
There is a simple solution to that problem, however. In practice most modelers
incorporate a constant positive probability of death in their models, following Blanchard
(1985). Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2017) show that for probabilities of
death that exceed a threshold that depends on the size of the permanent shocks, the
distribution of permanent income has a finite variance. In such cases, numerical results
confirm the intuition that the growth rate of aggregate assets ends up matching the
growth rate of permanent income.
Matters are simpler if there are no permanent shocks; see E for a proof that in that
case the growth rate of assets (and other variables) does eventually converge to the
growth rate of aggregate permanent income.

5 Conclusions
This paper provides theoretical foundations for many characteristics of buffer stock
saving models that have heretofore been observed in numerical solutions but not
proven. Perhaps the most important such proposition is the existence of a target
cash-to-permanent-income ratio toward which actual resources will move. The intuition
provided by the existence of such a target can be a powerful aid to understanding a
host of numerical results.
Another contribution is integration of the paper’s results with the open-source EconARK toolkit, which is used to generate all of the quantitative results of the paper, and
which integrally incorporates all of the analytical insights of the paper.

Appendices
A Perfect Foresight Liquidity Constrained Solution
Under perfect foresight in the presence of a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0, this
appendix taxonomizes the varieties of the limiting consumption function c̀(m) that arise
under various parametric conditions. Results are summarized in table 5.

A.1 If PF-GIC Fails
A consumer is ‘growth patient’ if the perfect foresight growth impatience condition
(
(
(((
(((
fails ((
PF-GIC,
1 < Þ /Γ). Under (
PF-GIC
the constraint does not bind at the lowest
feasible value of mt = 1 because 1 < (Rβ)1/ρ /Γ implies that spending everything today
(setting ct = mt = 1) produces lower marginal utility than is obtainable by reallocating
a marginal unit of resources to the next period at return R:44
1 < (Rβ)1/ρ Γ−1
1 < RβΓ−ρ
u0 (1) < Rβu0 (Γ).

(56)

Similar logic shows that under these circumstances the constraint will never bind at
m = 1 for a constrained consumer with a finite horizon of n periods, so for m ≥ 1
such a consumer’s consumption function will be the same as for the unconstrained case
examined in the main text.
If the RIC fails (1 < Þ R ) while the finite human wealth condition holds, the limiting
value of this consumption function as n ↑ ∞ is the degenerate function
c̀T −n (m) = 0(bt + h).

(57)

(that is, consumption is zero for any level of human or nonhuman wealth).
If the RIC fails and the FHWC fails, human wealth limits to h = ∞ so the consumption
function limits to either c̀T −n (m) = 0 or c̀T −n (m) = ∞ depending on the relative speeds
with which the MPC approaches zero and human wealth approaches ∞.45
Thus, the requirement that the consumption function be nondegenerate implies that
(
(((
PF-GIC
we must impose the RIC (and the FHWC can be
for a consumer satisfying (
(
(((
PF-GIC
and RIC). In this case, the consumer’s optimal
shown to be a consequence of (
behavior is easy to describe. We can calculate the point at which the unconstrained
consumer would choose c = m from equation (21):
m# = (m# − 1 + h)κ
44

(58)

The point at which the constraint would bind (if that point could be attained) is the m = c for
which u0 (c# ) = Rβu0 (Γ) which is c# = Γ/(Rβ)1/ρ and the consumption function will be defined by
c̀(m) = min[m, c# + (m − c# )κ].
45
The knife-edge case is where Þ = Γ, in which case the two quantites counterbalance and the
limiting function is c̀(m) = min[m, 1].

which (under these assumptions) satisfies 0 < m# < 1.46 For m < m# the unconstrained
consumer would choose to consume more than m; for such m, the constrained consumer
is obliged to choose c̀(m) = m.47 For any m > m# the constraint will never bind and the
consumer will choose to spend the same amount as the unconstrained consumer, c̄(m).
(Stachurski and Toda (2019) obtain a similar lower bound on consumption and use it
to study the tail behavior of the wealth distribution.)

A.2 If PF-GIC Holds
Imposition of the PF-GIC reverses the inequality in (56), and thus reverses the conclusion: A consumer who starts with mt = 1 will desire to consume more than 1. Such a
consumer will be constrained, not only in period t, but perpetually thereafter.
Now define bn# as the bt such that an unconstrained consumer holding bt = bn# would
behave so as to arrive in period t + n with bt+n = 0 (with b0# trivially equal to 0); for
example, a consumer with bt−1 = b1# was on the ‘cusp’ of being constrained in period t−1:
Had bt−1 been infinitesimally smaller, the constraint would have been binding (because
the consumer would have desired, but been unable, to enter period t with negative, not
zero, b). Given the PF-GIC, the constraint certainly binds in period t (and thereafter)
with resources of mt = m0# = 1 + b0# = 1: The consumer cannot spend more (because
constrained), and will not choose to spend less (because impatient), than ct = c0# = 1.
We can construct the entire ‘prehistory’ of this consumer leading up to t as follows.
Maintaining the assumption that the constraint has never bound in the past, c must
have been growing according to Þ Γ , so consumption n periods in the past must have
been

Note that 0 < m# is implied by RIC and m# < 1 is implied by (

As an illustration, consider a consumer for whom Þ = 1, R = 1.01 and Γ = 0.99. This consumer will
save the amount necessary to ensure that growth in market wealth exactly offsets the decline in human
wealth represented by Γ < 1; total wealth (and therefore total consumption) will remain constant, even
as market wealth and human wealth trend in opposite directions.
47

and note that the consumer’s human wealth between t − n and t (the relevant time
horizon, because from t onward the consumer will be constrained and unable to access
post-t income) is
hn# = 1 + ... + R−n

(64)

while the intertemporal budget constraint says

Ctt−n = bn# + hn#
from which we can solve for the bn# such that the consumer with bt−n = bn# would

Defining mn# = bn# + 1, consider the function c̀(m) defined by linearly connecting the
points {mn# , cn# } for integer values of n ≥ 0 (and setting c̀(m) = m for m < 1). This
function will return, for any value of m, the optimal value of c for a liquidity constrained
consumer with an infinite horizon. The function is piecewise linear with ‘kink points’
where the slope discretely changes; for infinitesimal  the MPC of a consumer with assets
m = mn# −  is discretely higher than for a consumer with assets m = mn# +  because
the latter consumer will spread a marginal dollar over more periods before exhausting
it.
In order for a unique consumption function to be defined by this sequence (65) for the
entire domain of positive real values of b, we need bn# to become arbitrarily large with
n. That is, we need
lim bn# = ∞.

A.2.1 If FHWC Holds

the FHWC R > Γ holds, the PF-GIC is stronger (harder to satisfy) than the RIC; thus,
the FHWC and the PF-GIC together imply the RIC, and so a well-defined solution exists.
Furthermore, in the limit as n approaches infinity, the difference between the limiting
constrained consumption function and the unconstrained consumption function becomes

vanishingly small, because the date at which the constraint binds becomes arbitrarily
distant, so the effect of that constraint on current behavior shrinks to nothing. That is,

but that limit is approached gradually, starting from a positive value, and consequently
the consumption function is not the degenerate c̀(m) = 0. (Figure 8 presents an example
for ρ = 2, R = 0.98, β = 1.00, Γ = 0.99; note that the horizontal axis is bank balances
b = m−1; the part of the consumption function below the depicted points is uninteresting
– c = m – so not worth plotting).
We can summarize as follows. Given that the PF-GIC holds, the interesting question is
whether the FHWC holds. If so, the RIC automatically holds, and the solution limits into
the solution to the unconstrained problem as m ↑ ∞. But even if the FHWC fails, the
problem has a well-defined and nondegenerate solution, whether or not the RIC holds.
Although these results were derived for the perfect foresight case, we know from work
elsewhere in this paper and in other places that the perfect foresight case is an upper
bound for the case with uncertainty. If the upper bound of the MPC in the perfect
foresight case is zero, it is not possible for the upper bound in the model with uncertainty
to be greater than zero, because for any κ > 0 the level of consumption in the model
with uncertainty would eventually exceed the level of consumption in the absence of
uncertainty.

B Existence of a Concave Consumption Function
To show that (6) defines a sequence of continuously differentiable strictly increasing
concave functions {cT , cT −1 , ..., cT −k }, we start with a definition. We will say that a
function n(z) is ‘nice’ if it satisfies
1. n(z) is well-defined iff z > 0
2. n(z) is strictly increasing
3. n(z) is strictly concave
4. n(z) is C3
5. n(z) < 0
6. limz↓0 n(z) = −∞.
(Notice that an implication of niceness is that limz↓0 n0 (z) = ∞.)
Assume that some vt+1 is nice. Our objective is to show that this implies vt is also
nice; this is sufficient to establish that vt−n is nice by induction for all n > 0 because
vT (m) = u(m) and u(m) = m1−ρ /(1 − ρ) is nice by inspection.
Now define an end-of-period value function vt (a) as

 1−ρ
vt (a) = β Et Γt+1
vt+1 (Rt+1 a + ξt+1 ) .
(75)

43

Since there is a positive probability that ξt+1 will attain its minimum of zero and since
Rt+1 > 0, it is clear that lima↓0 vt (a) = −∞ and lima↓0 v0t (a) = ∞. So vt (a) is welldefined iff a > 0; it is similarly straightforward to show the other properties required for
vt (a) to be nice. (See Hiraguchi (2003).)
Next define vt (m, c) as
vt (m, c) = u(c) + vt (m − c)

(76)

vt (m) = max vt (m, c).

(77)

which is C3 since vt and u are both C3 , and note that our problem’s value function
defined in (6) can be written as
c

vt is well-defined if and only if 0 < c < m. Furthermore, limc↓0 vt (m, c) =
∂ 2 vt (m,c)
∂v (m,c)
∂v (m,c)
limc↑m vt (m, c) = −∞, ∂c
< 0, limc↓0 t∂c = +∞, and limc↑m t∂c = −∞. It
2
follows that the ct (m) defined by
(78)

ct (m) = arg max vt (m, c)
0<c<m

exists and is unique, and (6) has an internal solution that satisfies
(79)

u0 (ct (m)) = v0t (m − ct (m)).

Since both u and vt are strictly concave, both ct (m) and at (m) = m−ct (m) are strictly
increasing. Since both u and vt are three times continuously differentiable, using (79)
we can conclude that ct (m) is continuously differentiable and
c0t (m) =

v00t (at (m))
.
u00 (ct (m)) + v00t (at (m))

(80)

Similarly we can easily show that ct (m) is twice continuously differentiable (as is at (m))
(See Appendix C.) This implies that vt (m) is nice, since vt (m) = u(ct (m)) + vt (at (m)).

C ct(m) is Twice Continuously Differentiable
First we show that ct (m) is C1 . Define y as y ≡ m + dm. Since u0 (ct (y)) − u0 (ct (m)) =
t (m)
t (m)
v0t (at (y)) − v0t (at (m)) and at (y)−a

+
ct (y) − ct (m)

Since ct and at are continuous and increasing,

This implies that the right-derivative, c0+

0
Similarly we can show that c0+
t (m) = ct (m), which means ct (m) exists. Since vt is
C3 , c0t (m) exists and is continuous. c0t (m) is differentiable because v00t is C1 , ct (m) is C1
and u00 (ct (m)) + v00t (at (m)) < 0. c00t (m) is given by

c00t (m) =

[u00 (ct ) + v00t (at )]2

(81)

Since v00t (at (m)) is continuous, c00t (m) is also continuous.

D Proof that T Is a Contraction Mapping
We must show that our operator T satisfies all of Boyd’s conditions.
Boyd’s operator T maps from Cz (A, B) to C(A, B). A preliminary requirement is
therefore that {Tz} be continuous for any z−bounded z, {Tz} ∈ C(R++ , R). This is
not difficult to show; see Hiraguchi (2003).
Consider condition (1). For this problem,

ct ∈[κmt ,κ̄mt ]

so x(•) ≤ y(•) implies {Tx}(mt ) ≤ {Ty}(mt ) by inspection.50
Condition (2) requires that {T0} ∈ Cz (A, B). By definition,

z-bounded. We use the bounding function
z(m) = η + m1−ρ ,

(82)

for some real scalar η > 0 whose value will be determined in the course of the proof.
Under this definition of z, {T0}(mt ) = u(κ̄mt ) is clearly z-bounded.
Finally, we turn to condition (3), {T(z + ζz)}(mt ) ≤ {Tz}(mt ) + ζαz(mt ). The proof

For a fixed mt , recall that mt+1 is just a function of ct and the stochastic shocks.

will be more compact if we define c̆ and ă as the consumption and assets functions51
associated with Tz and ĉ and â as the functions associated with T(z + ζz); using this
notation, condition (3) can be rewritten
u(ĉ) + β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ u(c̆) + β{Ez}(ă) + ζαz.

Now note that if we force the ^ consumer to consume the amount that is optimal for
the ∧ consumer, value for the ^ consumer must decline (at least weakly). That is,
u(ĉ) + β{Ez}(â) ≤ u(c̆) + β{Ez}(ă).

Thus, condition (3) will certainly hold under the stronger condition
u(ĉ) + β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ u(ĉ) + β{Ez}(â) + ζαz
β{E(z + ζz)}(â) ≤ β{Ez}(â) + ζαz
βζ{Ez}(â) ≤ ζαz
β{Ez}(â) ≤ αz
β{Ez}(â) < z.

Section 2.7 proves existence of a continuously differentiable consumption function, which implies
the existence of a corresponding continuously differentiable assets function.

which is a positive finite number under our assumptions.
The proof that T defines a contraction mapping under the conditions (37) and (33) is
now complete.
η>η=

D.1 T and v
In defining our operator T we made the restriction κmt ≤ ct ≤ κ̄mt . However, in the
discussion of the consumption function bounds, we showed only (in (38)) that κt mt ≤
ct (mt ) ≤ κ̄t mt . (The difference is in the presence or absence of time subscripts on the
MPC’s.) We have therefore not proven (yet) that the sequence of value functions (6)
defines a contraction mapping.
Fortunately, the proof of that proposition is identical to the proof above, except that
we must replace κ̄ with κ̄T −1 and the WRIC must be replaced by a slightly stronger
(but still quite weak) condition. The place where these conditions have force is in the
step at (84). Consideration of the prior two equations reveals that a sufficient stronger
condition is
℘β(R(1 − κ̄T −1 ))1−ρ < 1

(℘β)1/(1−ρ) (1 − κ̄T −1 ) > 1

(℘β)1/(1−ρ) (1 − (1 + ℘1/ρÞ R )−1 ) > 1

where we have used (36) for κ̄T −1 (and in the second step the reversal of the inequality
occurs because we have assumed ρ > 1 so that we are exponentiating both sides by the
negative number 1 − ρ). To see that this is a weak condition, note that for small values
of ℘ this expression can be further simplified using (1 + ℘1/ρÞ R )−1 ≈ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R so that
it becomes
(℘β)1/(1−ρ) ℘1/ρÞR > 1
(℘β)℘(1−ρ)/ρÞ R1−ρ < 1

β℘1/ρÞ R1−ρ < 1.

Calling the weak return patience factor Þ℘R = ℘1/ρÞR and recalling that the WRIC was
Þ−ρ
Þ ℘R < 1, the expression on the LHS above is βÞ
R times the WRPF. Since we usually
assume β not far below 1 and parameter values such that Þ R ≈ 1, this condition is
clearly not very different from the WRIC.
The upshot is that under these slightly stronger conditions the value functions for
the original problem define a contraction mapping with a unique v(m). But since
limn→∞ κT −n = κ and limn→∞ κ̄T −n = κ̄, it must be the case that the v(m) toward which
these vT −n ’s are converging is the same v(m) that was the endpoint of the contraction
defined by our operator T. Thus, under our slightly stronger (but still quite weak)

47

conditions, not only do the value functions defined by (6) converge, they converge to the
same unique v defined by T.53

D.2 Convergence of vt in Euclidian Space
Boyd’s theorem shows that T defines a contraction mapping in a z-bounded space. We
now show that T also defines a contraction mapping in Euclidian space.
Calling v∗ the unique fixed point of the operator T, since v∗ (m) = Tv∗ (m),
kvT −n+1 − v∗ kz ≤ αn−1 kvT − v∗ kz .

(86)

|vT −n+1 (m) − v∗ (m)| ≤ καn−1 |z(m)| .

(87)

lim vT −n+1 (m) = v∗ (m).

(88)

On the other hand, vT − v∗ ∈ Cz (A, B) and κ = kvT − v∗ kz < ∞ because vT and v∗
are in Cz (A, B). It follows that
Then we obtain

n→∞
1−ρ

1−ρ

Since vT (m) = m1−ρ , vT −1 (m) ≤ (κ̄m)
< vT (m). On the other hand, vT −1 ≤
1−ρ
vT means TvT −1 ≤ TvT , in other words, vT −2 (m) ≤ vT −1 (m). Inductively one gets
vT −n (m) ≥ vT −n−1 (m). This means that {vT −n+1 (m)}∞
n=1 is a decreasing sequence,
bounded below by v∗ .

D.3 Convergence of ct
Given the proof that the value functions converge, we now show the pointwise conver∞
gence of consumption functions {cT −n+1 (m)}
 n=1 .
Consider any convergent subsequence cT −n(i) (m) of {cT −n+1 (m)}∞
n=1 converging to
c∗ . By the definition of cT −n (m), we have
1−ρ
u(cT −n(i) (m))+β ET −n(i) [Γ1−ρ
T −n(i)+1 vT −n(i)+1 (m)] ≥ u(cT −n(i) )+β ET −n(i) [ΓT −n(i)+1 vT −n(i)+1 (m)],
(89)
for any cT −n(i) ∈ [κm, κ̄m]. Now letting n(i) go to infinity, it follows that the left
hand side converges to u(c∗ ) + β Et [Γ1−ρ
v(m)], and the right hand side converges to
t
1−ρ
u(cT −n(i) ) + β Et [Γt v(m)]. So the limit of the preceding inequality as n(i) approaches
infinity implies

Hence, c∗ ∈

1−ρ
u(c∗ ) + β Et [Γ1−ρ

t+1 v(m)] ≥ u(cT −n(i) ) + β Et [Γt+1 v(m)].

arg max
u(cT −n(i) ) + β Et [Γ1−ρ
t+1 v(m)] . By the uniqueness of c(m),

cT −n(i) ∈[κm,κ̄m]

∗

c = c(m).

53

It seems likely that convergence of the value functions for the original problem could be proven
even if only the WRIC were imposed; but that proof is not an essential part of the enterprise of this
paper and is therefore left for future work.

the growth factor for aggregate consumption approaches that for aggregate permanent
income. This section establishes that result.
First define a(m) as the function that yields optimal end-of-period assets as a function
of m.
Suppose the population starts in period t with an arbitrary value for covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i ).
Then if m̆ is the invariant mean level of m we can define a ‘mean MPS away from m̆’
function :
Z m̆+∆
¯á(∆) = ∆−1
a0 (z)dz

where the combination of the bar and the´are meant to signify that this is the average
value of the derivative over the interval. Since ψt+1,i = 1, Rt+1,i is a constant at R, if
we define a as the value of a corresponding to m = m̆, we can write
mt+1,i

at+1,i
so

covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i ) = covt á(Ra
t,i + ξt+1,i − m̆), Γpt,i .

But since R−1 (℘Rβ)1/ρ < á(m)

Þat+1,i , pt+1,i )|
|covt ((℘Rβ)1/ρ at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < |covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < |covt (Þ

and for the version of the model with no permanent shocks the GIC says that Þ < Γ,
while the FHWC says that Γ < R
|covt (at+1,i , pt+1,i )| < Γ|covt (at,i , pt,i )|.

This means that from any arbitrary starting value, the relative size of the covariance
term shrinks to zero over time (compared to the AΓn term which is growing steadily by
the factor Γ). Thus, limn→∞ At+n+1 /At+n = Γ.
This logic unfortunately does not go through when there are permanent shocks,
because the Rt+1,i terms are not independent of the permanent income shocks.
To see the problem clearly, define R̆ = M [Rt+1,i ] and consider a first order Taylor
¯ t+1,i ) around m̌t+1,i = R̆at,i + 1,
expansion of á(m
¯ m̌t+1,i ) + á¯0 (m̌t+1,i ) (mt+1,i − m̌t+1,i ) .
á¯t+1,i ≈ á(

The problem comes from the á¯0 term. The concavity of the consumption function
implies convexity of the a function, so this term is strictly positive but we have no theory

a (locally) unboundedly positive effect on á¯0 (as for instance if it pushes the consumer
arbitrarily close to the self-imposed liquidity constraint).

F The Limiting MPC’s
For mt > 0 we can define et (mt ) = ct (mt )/mt and at (mt ) = mt − ct (mt ) and the Euler
equation (7) can be rewritten

Consider the first conditional expectation in (91), recalling that if ξt+1 > 0 then
ξt+1 ≡ θt+1 /(1 − ℘). Since limm↓0 at (m) = 0, Et [(et+1 (mt+1 )mt+1 Γt+1 )−ρ | ξt+1 > 0]
is contained within bounds defined by (et+1 (θ/(1 − ℘))Γψθ/(1 − ℘))−ρ and
(et+1 (θ̄/(1 − ℘))Γψ̄ θ̄/(1 − ℘))−ρ both of which are finite numbers, implying that
the whole term multiplied by (1 − ℘) goes to zero as mρt goes to zero. As mt ↓ 0
−ρ
the expectation in the other term goes to κ̄−ρ
t+1 (1 − κ̄t ) . (This follows from the strict
concavity and differentiability of the consumption function.) It follows that the limiting

κ̄t+1 (1 − κ̄t )−ρ . Exponentiating by ρ, we can conclude that

(95)

lim κ̄T −n = κ̄ ≡ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R

(96)

Since κ̄T = 1, iterating (94) backward to infinity (because we are interested in the
limiting consumption function) we obtain:
n→∞

50

and we will therefore call κ̄ the ‘limiting maximal MPC.’
The minimal MPC’s are obtained by considering the case where mt ↑ ∞. If the
FHWC holds, then as mt ↑ ∞ the proportion of current and future consumption that
will be financed out of capital approaches 1. Thus, the terms involving ξt+1 in (91) can
be neglected, leading to a revised limiting Euler equation


(mt et (mt ))−ρ = βR Et (et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) (Rat (mt )))−ρ
and we know from L’Hôpital’s rule that limmt →∞ et (mt ) = κt , and limmt →∞ et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) =
κt+1 so a further limit of the Euler equation is

For the purpose of constructing the limiting perfect foresight consumption function,
it is useful further to note that the PDV of consumption is given by

(99)

G The Perfect Foresight Liquidity Constrained
Solution as a Limit
Formally, suppose we change the description of the problem by making the following
two assumptions:
℘ =0
ct ≤ mt ,

51

and we designate the solution to this consumer’s problem c̀t (m). We will henceforth refer
to this as the problem of the ‘restrained’ consumer (and, to avoid a common confusion,
we will refer to the consumer as ‘constrained’ only in circumstances when the constraint
is actually binding).
Redesignate the consumption function that emerges from our original problem for a
given fixed ℘ as ct (m; ℘) where we separate the arguments by a semicolon to distinguish
between m, which is a state variable, and ℘, which is not. The proposition we wish to
demonstrate is
lim ct (m; ℘) = c̀t (m).
℘↓0

(100)

We will first examine the problem in period T − 1, then argue that the desired result
propagates to earlier periods. For simplicity, suppose that the interest, growth, and
time-preference factors are β = R = Γ = 1, and there are no permanent shocks, ψ = 1;
the results below are easily generalized to the full-fledged version of the problem.
The solution to the restrained consumer’s optimization problem can be obtained as
follows. Assuming that the consumer’s behavior in period T is given by cT (m) (in
practice, this will be cT (m) = m), consider the unrestrained optimization problem
)
(
Z θ̄
à∗T −1 (m) = arg max u(m − a) +
vT (a + θ)dFθ .
(101)

As usual, the envelope theorem tells us that vT0 (m) = u0 (cT (m)) so the expected
marginal value of ending period T − 1 with assets a can be defined as
Z θ̄
0
v̀T −1 (a) ≡
u0 (cT (a + θ))dFθ ,
θ

and the solution to (101) will satisfy
u0 (m − a) = v̀0T −1 (a).

(102)

à∗T −1 (m) therefore answers the question “With what level of assets would the restrained
consumer like to end period T − 1 if the constraint cT −1 ≤ mT −1 did not exist?” (Note
that the restrained consumer’s income process remains different from the process for
the unrestrained consumer so long as ℘ > 0.) The restrained consumer’s actual asset
position will be
àT −1 (m) = max[0, à∗T −1 (m)],
reflecting the inability of the restrained consumer to spend more than current resources,
and note (as pointed out by Deaton (1991)) that
−1/ρ
m1# = v̀0T −1 (0)
is the cusp value of m at which the constraint makes the transition between binding and
non-binding in period T − 1.

(103)

the Euler equation for the original consumer’s problem implies
(m − a)−ρ = v0T −1 (a; ℘)

(104)

with solution a∗T −1 (m; ℘). Now note that for any fixed a > 0, lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a).
Since the LHS of (102) and (104) are identical, this means that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) =
à∗T −1 (m). That is, for any fixed value of m > m1# such that the consumer subject to the
restraint would voluntarily choose to end the period with positive assets, the level of endof-period assets for the unrestrained consumer approaches the level for the restrained
consumer as ℘ ↓ 0. With the same a and the same m, the consumers must have the
same c, so the consumption functions are identical in the limit.
Now consider values m ≤ m1# for which the restrained consumer is constrained. It
is obvious that the baseline consumer will never choose a ≤ 0 because the first term in
(103) is lima↓0 ℘a−ρ = ∞, while lima↓0 (m − a)−ρ is finite (the marginal value of endof-period assets approaches infinity as assets approach zero, but the marginal utility of
consumption has a finite limit for m > 0). The subtler question is whether it is possible
to rule out strictly positive a for the unrestrained consumer.
The answer is yes. Suppose, for some m < m1# , that the unrestrained consumer is
considering ending the period with any positive amount of assets a = δ > 0. For any such
δ we have that lim℘↓0 v0T −1 (a; ℘) = v̀0T −1 (a). But by assumption we are considering a set
of circumstances in which à∗T −1 (m) < 0, and we showed earlier that lim℘↓0 a∗T −1 (m; ℘) =
à∗T −1 (m). So, having assumed a = δ > 0, we have proven that the consumer would
optimally choose a < 0, which is a contradiction. A similar argument holds for m = m1# .
These arguments demonstrate that for any m > 0, lim℘↓0 cT −1 (m; ℘) = c̀T −1 (m) which
is the period T − 1 version of (100). But given equality of the period T − 1 consumption
functions, backwards recursion of the same arguments demonstrates that the limiting
consumption functions in previous periods are also identical to the constrained function.
Note finally that another intuitive confirmation of the equivalence between the two
problems is that our formula (96) for the maximal marginal propensity to consume
satisfies
lim κ̄ = 1,
℘↓0

which makes sense because the marginal propensity to consume for a constrained restrained consumer is 1 by our definitions of ‘constrained’ and ‘restrained.’

H Endogenous Gridpoints Solution Method
The model is solved using an extension of the method of endogenous gridpoints (Carroll
(2006)): A grid of possible values of end-of-period assets ~a is defined, and at these points,
marginal end-of-period-t value is computed as the discounted next-period expected

53

marginal utility of consumption (which the Envelope theorem says matches expected
marginal value). The results are then used to identify the corresponding levels of
consumption at the beginning of the period:54
u0 (ct (~a)) = Rβ Et [u0 (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))]
−1/ρ

.
~ct ≡ ct (~a) = Rβ Et (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))−ρ

(105)

The dynamic budget constraint can then be used to generate the corresponding m’s:
m
~ t = ~a + ~ct .
An approximation to the consumption function could be constructed by linear interpolation between the {m,
~ ~c} points. But a vastly more accurate approximation can
be made (for a given number of gridpoints) if the interpolation is constructed so that
it also matches the marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints. Differentiating
(105) with respect to a (and dropping policy function arguments for simplicity) yields a
marginal propensity to have consumed ca at each gridpoint:
u00 (ct )cat = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Γt+1 cm
t+1 Rt+1 ]
00
m
= Rβ Et [u (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rct+1 ]
a
00
ct = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rcm
t+1 ]/u (ct )

(106)

and the marginal propensity to consume at the beginning of the period is obtained from
the marginal propensity to have consumed by noting that, if we define m(a) = c(a) − a,
c=m−a
ca + 1 = ma

which, together with the chain rule ca = cm ma , yields the MPC from
cm (ca + 1) = ca
cm = ca /(1 + ca )
and we call the vector of MPC’s at the m
~ t gridpoints ~κt .

I The Terminal/Limiting Consumption Function
For any set of parameter values that satisfy the conditions required for convergence,
the problem can be solved by setting the terminal consumption function to cT (m) =
m and constructing {cT −1 , cT −2 , ...} by time iteration (a method that will converge to
c(m) by standard theorems). But cT (m) = m is very far from the final converged

54

The software can also solve a version of the model with explicit liquidity constraints, where the
Envelope condition does not hold.

54

consumption rule c(m),55 and thus many periods of iteration will likely be required to
obtain a candidate rule that even remotely resembles the converged function.
A natural alternative choice for the terminal consumption rule is the solution to the
perfect foresight liquidity constrained problem, to which the model’s solution converges
(under specified parametric restrictions) as all forms of uncertainty approach zero (as
discussed in the main text). But a difficulty with this idea is that the perfect foresight
liquidity constrained solution is ‘kinked:’ The slope of the consumption function changes
discretely at the points {m1# , m2# , ...}. This is a practical problem because it rules out
the use of derivatives of the consumption function in the approximate representation of
c(m), thereby preventing the enormous increase in efficiency obtainable from a higherorder approximation.
Our solution is simple: The formulae in another appendix that identify kink points on
c̊(m) for integer values of n (e.g., cn# = Þ −n
Γ ) are continuous functions of n; the conclusion
that c̊(m) is piecewise linear between the kink points does not require that the terminal
consumption rule (from which time iteration proceeds) also be piecewise linear. Thus,
for values n ≥ 0 we can construct a smooth function c̆(m) that matches the true perfect
foresight liquidity constrained consumption function at the set of points corresponding
to integer periods in the future, but satisfies the (continuous, and greater at non-kink
points) consumption rule defined from the appendix’s formulas by noninteger values of
n at other points.56
This strategy generates a smooth limiting consumption function – except at the
remaining kink point defined by {m0# , c0# }. Below this point, the solution must match
c(m) = m because the constraint is binding. At m = m0# the MPC discretely drops
(that is, limm↑m0# c0 (m) = 1 while limm↓m0# c0 (m) = κ0# < 1).
Such a kink point causes substantial problems for numerical solution methods (like the
one we use, described below) that rely upon the smoothness of the limiting consumption
function.
Our solution is to use, as the terminal consumption rule, a function that is identical
to the (smooth) continuous consumption rule c̆(m) above some n ≥ n, but to replace
c̆(m) between m0# and mn# with the unique polynomial function ĉ(m) that satisfies the
following criteria:
1. ĉ(m0# ) = c0#
2. ĉ0 (m0# ) = 1
n
) = (dcn# /dn)(dmn# /dn)−1 |n=n
3. ĉ0 (m#
n
4. ĉ00 (m#
) = (d2 cn# /dn2 )(d2 mn# /dn2 )−1 |n=n

where n is chosen judgmentally in a way calculated to generate a good compromise
between smoothness of the limiting consumption function c̆(m) and fidelity of that
function to the c̊(m) (see the actual code for details).
55

Unless β ≈ +0.
In practice, we calculate the first and second derivatives of c̊ and use piecewise polynomial
approximation methods that match the function at these points.
56

55

We thus define the terminal function as

0

0 < m ≤ m#
n
cT (m) = m0# < m < m#

 n
m# < m

m
c̆(m)
c̊(m)

(107)

Since the precautionary motive implies that in the presence of uncertainty the optimal
level of consumption is below the level that is optimal without uncertainty, and since
c̆(m) ≥ c̊(m), implicitly defining m = eµ (so that µ = log m), we can construct
χt (µ) = log(1 − ct (eµ )/cT (eµ ))

(108)

c0t = (ct c0T /cT ) − ((cT − ct )/m)χ0t .

(110)


ct (m) = 1 − eχt (log m) cT (m).

(111)

which must be a number between −∞ and +∞ (since 0 < ct (m) < c̆(m) for m > 0).
This function turns out to be much better behaved (as a numerical observation; no formal
proof is offered) than the level of the optimal consumption rule ct (m). In particular,
χt (µ) is well approximated by linear functions both as m ↓ 0 and as m ↑ ∞.
Differentiating with respect to µ and dropping consumption function arguments yields
  c0 c −c c0  
− t Tc2 t T eµ
T


(109)
χt (µ) = 
1 − ct /cT
which can be solved for
Similarly, we can solve (108) for

Thus, having approximated χt , we can recover from it the level and derivative(s) of
ct .

J Relational Diagrams for the Inequality Conditions

Figure J.1 should be read as follows. The three nodes represent the values of the
absolute patience factor Þ, the growth factor for permanent income Γ, and the riskfree
interest factor R. The arrows between these quantities represent imposition of the labeled
condition. For example, the uppermost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, reflects imposition
of the PF-GIC condition. To make interpretation of the diagram easy, the mathematical
representation of the condition is expressed in parentheses as being equivalent (≡) to
the condition.
The imposition of the negation of the PF-GIC (the lower curved arrow pointing from Γ

which illustrates another aspect of the diagram: If all arrows are reversed in a partial
traversal of the diagram leading to a final step, then the arrow for the final step must
also be reversed. In this case, since both conditions leading to R have had their arrows
reversed, the arrow coming out of R should also be reversed, implying the negation of
the RIC – as (112) proved.
For clarity, further diagrams will omit multiple arrows indicating reversal of causality
(in Figure J.1 there would, for example, be only a single arrow, from Þ to Γ, at the top
level of the diagram). And definitions of conditions will also be omitted henceforth.
Under these conventions, we can extend the diagram to incorporate the PF-FVAC

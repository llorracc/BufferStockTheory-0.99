Table 3 Definitions and Comparisons of Conditions
Perfect Foresight Versions
Uncertainty Versions
Finite Human Wealth Condition (FHWC)
Γ/R < 1
Γ/R < 1
The growth factor for permanent income
Γ must be smaller than the discounting
factor R for human wealth to be finite.

The model’s risks are mean-preserving
spreads, so the PDV of future income is
unchanged by their introduction.

Absolute Impatience Condition (AIC)
Þ<1
Þ<1

The unconstrained consumer is
sufficiently impatient that the level of
consumption will be declining over time:

If wealth is large enough, the expectation
of consumption next period will be
smaller than this period’s consumption:

ct+1 < ct

limmt →∞ Et [ct+1 ] < ct

Return Impatience Conditions
Return Impatience Condition (RIC)
Weak RIC (WRIC)
Þ /R < 1
℘1/ρÞ /R < 1
The growth factor for consumption Þ
must be smaller than the discounting
factor R, so that the PDV of current and
future consumption will be finite:

If the probability of the zero-income
event is ℘ = 1 then income is always zero
and the condition becomes identical to
the RIC. Otherwise, weaker.

c0 (m) = 1 − Þ /R < 1

c0 (m) < 1 − ℘1/ρÞ /R < 1

Growth Impatience Conditions
PF-GIC
Þ /Γ < 1

GIC
Þ E[ψ −1 ]/Γ < 1

Guarantees that for an unconstrained
consumer, the ratio of consumption to
permanent income will fall over time. For
a constrained consumer, guarantees the
constraint will eventually be binding.

By Jensen’s inequality, stronger than
the PF-GIC.
Ensures consumers will not
expect to accumulate m unboundedly.

PF-FVAC
FVAC
1−ρ
1−ρ
βΓ
<1
βΓ E[ψ 1−ρ ] < 1
equivalently Þ /Γ < (R/Γ)1/ρ

The discounted utility of constrained
consumers who spend their permanent
income each period should be finite.

By Jensen’s inequality, stronger than the
PF-FVAC because for ρ > 1 and
nondegenerate ψ, E[ψ 1−ρ ] > 1.

Solution
Under perfect foresight in the presence of a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0,
this appendix taxonomizes the varieties of the limiting consumption function c̀(m)
that arise under various parametric conditions. Results are summarized in table 1.

1.1 If PF-GIC Fails
A consumer is ‘growth patient’ if the perfect foresight growth impatience condition
(
(

fails ((
PF-GIC,
1 < Þ /Γ). Under (
PF-GIC
the constraint does not bind at the lowest
feasible value of mt = 1 because 1 < (Rβ)1/ρ /Γ implies that spending everything
today (setting ct = mt = 1) produces lower marginal utility than is obtainable by
reallocating a marginal unit of resources to the next period at return R:1
1 < (Rβ)1/ρ Γ−1
1 < RβΓ−ρ
u0 (1) < Rβu0 (Γ).

(1)

Similar logic shows that under these circumstances the constraint will never
bind at m = 1 for a constrained consumer with a finite horizon of n periods, so
for m ≥ 1 such a consumer’s consumption function will be the same as for the
unconstrained case examined in the main text.
If the RIC fails (1 < Þ R ) while the finite human wealth condition holds, the
limiting value of this consumption function as n ↑ ∞ is the degenerate function
c̀T −n (m) = 0(bt + h).

(2)

(that is, consumption is zero for any level of human or nonhuman wealth).
If the RIC fails and the FHWC fails, human wealth limits to h = ∞ so the
consumption function limits to either c̀T −n (m) = 0 or c̀T −n (m) = ∞ depending
on the relative speeds with which the MPC approaches zero and human wealth
approaches ∞.2
Thus, the requirement that the consumption function be nondegenerate im(

PF-GIC
we must impose the RIC (and the
plies that for a consumer satisfying (
(
(((
FHWC can be shown to be a consequence of (
PF-GIC
and RIC). In this case, the
consumer’s optimal behavior is easy to describe. We can calculate the point at
which the unconstrained consumer would choose c = m from equation (21):
m# = (m# − 1 + h)κ
m# (1 − κ) = (h − 1)κ


κ
m# = (h − 1)
1−κ

(5)

The point at which the constraint would bind (if that point could be attained) is the m = c
for which u0 (c# ) = Rβu0 (Γ) which is c# = Γ/(Rβ)1/ρ and the consumption function will be
defined by c̀(m) = min[m, c# + (m − c# )κ].
2
The knife-edge case is where Þ = Γ, in which case the two quantites counterbalance and
the limiting function is c̀(m) = min[m, 1].

which (under these assumptions) satisfies 0 < m# < 1.3 For m < m# the
unconstrained consumer would choose to consume more than m; for such m,
the constrained consumer is obliged to choose c̀(m) = m.4 For any m > m#
the constraint will never bind and the consumer will choose to spend the same
amount as the unconstrained consumer, c̄(m).
(Stachurski and Toda (2019) obtain a similar lower bound on consumption and
use it to study the tail behavior of the wealth distribution.)

1.2 If PF-GIC Holds
Imposition of the PF-GIC reverses the inequality in (1), and thus reverses the
conclusion: A consumer who starts with mt = 1 will desire to consume more than
1. Such a consumer will be constrained, not only in period t, but perpetually
thereafter.
Now define bn# as the bt such that an unconstrained consumer holding bt = bn#
would behave so as to arrive in period t+n with bt+n = 0 (with b0# trivially equal to
0); for example, a consumer with bt−1 = b1# was on the ‘cusp’ of being constrained
in period t − 1: Had bt−1 been infinitesimally smaller, the constraint would have
been binding (because the consumer would have desired, but been unable, to enter
period t with negative, not zero, b). Given the PF-GIC, the constraint certainly
binds in period t (and thereafter) with resources of mt = m0# = 1 + b0# = 1: The
consumer cannot spend more (because constrained), and will not choose to spend
less (because impatient), than ct = c0# = 1.
We can construct the entire ‘prehistory’ of this consumer leading up to t as
follows. Maintaining the assumption that the constraint has never bound in the
past, c must have been growing according to Þ Γ , so consumption n periods in the
past must have been

As an illustration, consider a consumer for whom Þ = 1, R = 1.01 and Γ = 0.99. This
consumer will save the amount necessary to ensure that growth in market wealth exactly offsets
the decline in human wealth represented by Γ < 1; total wealth (and therefore total consumption)
will remain constant, even as market wealth and human wealth trend in opposite directions.

hn# = 1 + ... + R−n

(9)

while the intertemporal budget constraint says
Ctt−n = bn# + hn#
from which we can solve for the bn# such that the consumer with bt−n = bn# would
unconstrainedly plan (in period t − n) to arrive in period t with bt = 0:

Defining mn# = bn# +1, consider the function c̀(m) defined by linearly connecting
the points {mn# , cn# } for integer values of n ≥ 0 (and setting c̀(m) = m for m < 1).
This function will return, for any value of m, the optimal value of c for a liquidity
constrained consumer with an infinite horizon. The function is piecewise linear
with ‘kink points’ where the slope discretely changes; for infinitesimal  the MPC
of a consumer with assets m = mn# −  is discretely higher than for a consumer
with assets m = mn# +  because the latter consumer will spread a marginal dollar
over more periods before exhausting it.
In order for a unique consumption function to be defined by this sequence (10)
for the entire domain of positive real values of b, we need bn# to become arbitrarily
large with n. That is, we need
lim bn
n→∞ #

= ∞.

1.2.1 If FHWC Holds
The FHWC requires R−1 < 1, in which case the second term in (10) limits to a
constant as n ↑ ∞, and (11) reduces to a requirement that

Given the PF-GIC Þ −1
Γ > 1, this will hold iff the RIC holds, Þ R < 1. But given
that the FHWC R > Γ holds, the PF-GIC is stronger (harder to satisfy) than
the RIC; thus, the FHWC and the PF-GIC together imply the RIC, and so a
well-defined solution exists. Furthermore, in the limit as n approaches infinity,
the difference between the limiting constrained consumption function and the
unconstrained consumption function becomes vanishingly small, because the date
at which the constraint binds becomes arbitrarily distant, so the effect of that

constraint on current behavior shrinks to nothing. That is,
lim c̀(m) − c̄(m) = 0.

Þ R R−1 − Þ R > R−1Þ R − R−1

but that limit is approached gradually, starting from a positive value, and consequently the consumption function is not the degenerate c̀(m) = 0. (Figure 1
presents an example for ρ = 2, R = 0.98, β = 1.00, Γ = 0.99; note that the
horizontal axis is bank balances b = m − 1; the part of the consumption function
below the depicted points is uninteresting – c = m – so not worth plotting).
We can summarize as follows. Given that the PF-GIC holds, the interesting
question is whether the FHWC holds. If so, the RIC automatically holds, and
the solution limits into the solution to the unconstrained problem as m ↑ ∞.
But even if the FHWC fails, the problem has a well-defined and nondegenerate
solution, whether or not the RIC holds.
Although these results were derived for the perfect foresight case, we know from
work elsewhere in this paper and in other places that the perfect foresight case is
an upper bound for the case with uncertainty. If the upper bound of the MPC
in the perfect foresight case is zero, it is not possible for the upper bound in the
model with uncertainty to be greater than zero, because for any κ > 0 the level
of consumption in the model with uncertainty would eventually exceed the level
of consumption in the absence of uncertainty.
Ma and Toda (2020) characterize the limits of MPC in a more general framework
that allows for non-CRRA utility as well as capital and labor income risks in a
Markovian setting, and find that in that much more general framework the limiting
MPC is also zero.

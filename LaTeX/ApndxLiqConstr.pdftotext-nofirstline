Under perfect foresight in the presence of a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0, this
appendix taxonomizes the varieties of the limiting consumption function c̀(m) that arise
under various parametric conditions. Results are summarized in table 1.

1.1 If PF-GIC Fails
A consumer is ‘growth patient’ if the perfect foresight growth impatience condition
(
(

fails ((
PF-GIC,
1 < Þ /Γ). Under (
PF-GIC
the constraint does not bind at the lowest
feasible value of mt = 1 because 1 < (Rβ)1/ρ /Γ implies that spending everything today
(setting ct = mt = 1) produces lower marginal utility than is obtainable by reallocating
a marginal unit of resources to the next period at return R:1
1 < (Rβ)1/ρ Γ−1
1 < RβΓ−ρ
u0 (1) < Rβu0 (Γ).

(3)

Similar logic shows that under these circumstances the constraint will never bind at
m = 1 for a constrained consumer with a finite horizon of n periods, so for m ≥ 1
such a consumer’s consumption function will be the same as for the unconstrained case
examined in the main text.
If the RIC fails (1 < Þ R ) while the finite human wealth condition holds, the limiting
value of this consumption function as n ↑ ∞ is the degenerate function
c̀T −n (m) = 0(bt + h).

(4)

(that is, consumption is zero for any level of human or nonhuman wealth).
If the RIC fails and the FHWC fails, human wealth limits to h = ∞ so the consumption
function limits to either c̀T −n (m) = 0 or c̀T −n (m) = ∞ depending on the relative speeds
with which the MPC approaches zero and human wealth approaches ∞.2
Thus, the requirement that the consumption function be nondegenerate implies that
(

for a consumer satisfying (
PF-GIC
we must impose the RIC (and the FHWC can be
(
(((
shown to be a consequence of (
PF-GIC
and RIC). In this case, the consumer’s optimal
behavior is easy to describe. We can calculate the point at which the unconstrained
consumer would choose c = m from equation (??):
m# = (m# − 1 + h)κ
m# (1 − κ) = (h − 1)κ

m# = (h − 1)

(7)

The point at which the constraint would bind (if that point could be attained) is the m = c for
which u0 (c# ) = Rβu0 (Γ) which is c# = Γ/(Rβ)1/ρ and the consumption function will be defined by
c̀(m) = min[m, c# + (m − c# )κ].

The knife-edge case is where Þ = Γ, in which case the two quantites counterbalance and the
limiting function is c̀(m) = min[m, 1].

which (under these assumptions) satisfies 0 < m# < 1.3 For m < m# the unconstrained
consumer would choose to consume more than m; for such m, the constrained consumer
is obliged to choose c̀(m) = m.4 For any m > m# the constraint will never bind and the
consumer will choose to spend the same amount as the unconstrained consumer, c̄(m).
(Stachurski and Toda (2019) obtain a similar lower bound on consumption and use it
to study the tail behavior of the wealth distribution.)

1.2 If PF-GIC Holds
Imposition of the PF-GIC reverses the inequality in (3), and thus reverses the conclusion:
A consumer who starts with mt = 1 will desire to consume more than 1. Such a consumer
will be constrained, not only in period t, but perpetually thereafter.
Now define bn# as the bt such that an unconstrained consumer holding bt = bn# would
behave so as to arrive in period t + n with bt+n = 0 (with b0# trivially equal to 0); for
example, a consumer with bt−1 = b1# was on the ‘cusp’ of being constrained in period t−1:
Had bt−1 been infinitesimally smaller, the constraint would have been binding (because
the consumer would have desired, but been unable, to enter period t with negative, not
zero, b). Given the PF-GIC, the constraint certainly binds in period t (and thereafter)
with resources of mt = m0# = 1 + b0# = 1: The consumer cannot spend more (because
constrained), and will not choose to spend less (because impatient), than ct = c0# = 1.
We can construct the entire ‘prehistory’ of this consumer leading up to t as follows.
Maintaining the assumption that the constraint has never bound in the past, c must
have been growing according to Þ Γ , so consumption n periods in the past must have
been

The PDV of consumption from t − n until t can thus be computed as

and note that the consumer’s human wealth between t − n and t (the relevant time
horizon, because from t onward the consumer will be constrained and unable to access
post-t income) is
hn# = 1 + ... + R−n

Note that 0 < m# is implied by RIC and m# < 1 is implied by (
PF-GIC.
As an illustration, consider a consumer for whom Þ = 1, R = 1.01 and Γ = 0.99. This consumer will
save the amount necessary to ensure that growth in market wealth exactly offsets the decline in human
wealth represented by Γ < 1; total wealth (and therefore total consumption) will remain constant, even
as market wealth and human wealth trend in opposite directions.

while the intertemporal budget constraint says
Ctt−n = bn# + hn#
from which we can solve for the bn# such that the consumer with bt−n = bn# would

Defining mn# = bn# + 1, consider the function c̀(m) defined by linearly connecting the
points {mn# , cn# } for integer values of n ≥ 0 (and setting c̀(m) = m for m < 1). This
function will return, for any value of m, the optimal value of c for a liquidity constrained
consumer with an infinite horizon. The function is piecewise linear with ‘kink points’
where the slope discretely changes; for infinitesimal  the MPC of a consumer with assets
m = mn# −  is discretely higher than for a consumer with assets m = mn# +  because
the latter consumer will spread a marginal dollar over more periods before exhausting
it.
In order for a unique consumption function to be defined by this sequence (12) for the
entire domain of positive real values of b, we need bn# to become arbitrarily large with
n. That is, we need
lim bn# = ∞.

1.2.1 If FHWC Holds
The FHWC requires R−1 < 1, in which case the second term in (12) limits to a constant
as n ↑ ∞, and (13) reduces to a requirement that

Given the PF-GIC Þ −1
Γ > 1, this will hold iff the RIC holds, Þ R < 1. But given that
the FHWC R > Γ holds, the PF-GIC is stronger (harder to satisfy) than the RIC; thus,
the FHWC and the PF-GIC together imply the RIC, and so a well-defined solution exists.
Furthermore, in the limit as n approaches infinity, the difference between the limiting
constrained consumption function and the unconstrained consumption function becomes
vanishingly small, because the date at which the constraint binds becomes arbitrarily
distant, so the effect of that constraint on current behavior shrinks to nothing. That is,
lim c̀(m) − c̄(m) = 0.

but that limit is approached gradually, starting from a positive value, and consequently
the consumption function is not the degenerate c̀(m) = 0. (Figure 1 presents an example
for ρ = 2, R = 0.98, β = 1.00, Γ = 0.99; note that the horizontal axis is bank balances
b = m−1; the part of the consumption function below the depicted points is uninteresting
– c = m – so not worth plotting).
We can summarize as follows. Given that the PF-GIC holds, the interesting question is
whether the FHWC holds. If so, the RIC automatically holds, and the solution limits into
the solution to the unconstrained problem as m ↑ ∞. But even if the FHWC fails, the
problem has a well-defined and nondegenerate solution, whether or not the RIC holds.
Although these results were derived for the perfect foresight case, we know from work
elsewhere in this paper and in other places that the perfect foresight case is an upper
bound for the case with uncertainty. If the upper bound of the MPC in the perfect
foresight case is zero, it is not possible for the upper bound in the model with uncertainty
to be greater than zero, because for any κ > 0 the level of consumption in the model
with uncertainty would eventually exceed the level of consumption in the absence of
uncertainty.
Ma and Toda (2020) characterize the limits of MPC in a more general framework that
allows for non-CRRA utility as well as capital and labor income risks in a Markovian
setting, and find that in that much more general framework the limiting MPC is also
zero.

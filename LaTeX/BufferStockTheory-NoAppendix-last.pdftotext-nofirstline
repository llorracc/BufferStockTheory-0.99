Theoretical Foundations of
Buffer Stock Saving
October 19, 2020

Christopher D. Carroll1

Abstract
This paper builds theoretical foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding of ‘buffer
stock’ saving models, pairing each theoretical result with a quantitative exploration. After
describing conditions under which the consumption function exists, the paper shows that a
‘target’ buffer stock exists only under conditions strictly stronger than those that guarantee
convergence of the consumption and value functions. Furthermore, the average growth rate of
consumption equals the average growth rate of permanent income (in a small open economy
populated by buffer stock savers). Together, the (provided) numerical tools and (proven)
analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock models.

1 Introduction
In the presence of empirically realistic transitory and permanent shocks to income a la
Friedman (1957), only one further ingredient is required to construct a testable model of
optimal consumption: A description of preferences. Modelers usually assume geometric
discounting of a constant relative risk aversion utility function, because, starting with
Zeldes (1989) and Deaton (1991), a large literature has constructed numerical solutions
whose quantitative predictions match microeconomic evidence reasonably well.
A companion theoretical literature has shown that numerical solution methods provide
good approximations to limiting “true” mathematical solutions – but only for models
more complex than the simple case with just shocks and utility. The extra complexity has
been required because standard contraction mapping theorems (beginning with Bellman
(1957) and including those building on Stokey et. al. (1989)) cannot be applied when
the utility function is unbounded (like CRRA - see section 2.1).1
This paper’s first technical contribution is to articulate the (loose) conditions under
which the simple problem (without convenient shortcuts like a consumption floor or
liquidity constraints) defines a contraction mapping with a nondegenerate consumption
function. The interesting requirement is a ‘Finite Value of Autarky’ condition. The
paper’s second contribution is to specify the conditions under which the resulting consumption function implies existence of a ‘target’ wealth-to-permanent-income ratio (the
model exhibits ‘buffer stock’ saving behavior). Buffer stock behavior arises when the
model’s parameters satisfy a “Growth Impatience Condition” (equation (31)) that relates
preferences and uncertainty to predictable income growth.
Even without a formal proof, target saving of this kind has been intuitively understood
to underlie central quantitative results from the heterogeneous agent macroeconomics
literature; for example, the logic of target saving is central to the explanation by Krueger,
Mitman, and Perri (2016) of the fact that, during the Great Recession, middle-class
consumers cut their consumption more than the poor or the rich. The theoretical logic
articulated below explains why: Learning that the future has become more uncertain
does not change the urgent imperatives of the poor (their high u0 (c) means they have
little room to maneuver). And, increased labor income uncertainty does not change the
behavior of the rich because it does not threaten their consumption much. Only people
in the middle have both the motivation and the wiggle-room to reduce their discretionary
spending.
Conveniently, elements required for the convergence proof also provide analytical
foundations for many other results that have become familiar from the numerical litera1 It is unclear whether newer methods such as those of Matkowski and Nowak (2011) could overcome this problem,
or how difficult it would be to do so; but in any case this particular problem does not seem to have been tackled by those
methods or any others.

ture. In this paper, all theoretical conclusions are paired with numerically computed
illustrations (using the open-source Econ-ARK toolkit). The insights of the paper
are instantiated in the toolkit, whose buffer stock saving module algorithmically flags
parametric choices under which a problem fails to define a contraction mapping; a target
level of wealth does not exist; or the solution is otherwise surprising.
Such theoretical foundations are valuable both because they provide intuition about
the determinants of saving targets, and because they make it easier to develop reliable numerical solution methods (by providing necessary and sufficient restrictions that
solutions must satisfy).
The paper proceeds in three parts.
The first part articulates the conditions required for the problem to define a nondegenerate limiting consumption function, and explains how the paper’s model is more
general than those previously considered in the literature. The conditions required
for convergence are interestingly parallel to those required for the liquidity constrained
perfect foresight model; that parallel is explored and explained. Next, the paper derives
some limiting properties of the consumption function as resources (‘cash’) approach
infinity and as they approach their lower bound; then the theorem is proven explaining
when the problem defines a contraction mapping. Finally, a related class of commonlyused models (exemplified by Deaton (1991)) is shown to constitute a particular limit of
this paper’s model.
The next section examines five key properties of the model. First, as cash approaches
infinity the expected growth rate of consumption and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) converge to their values in the perfect foresight case. Second, as cash
approaches zero the expected growth rate of consumption approaches infinity, and the
MPC approaches a simple analytical limit. Third, if the consumer is ‘growth impatient,’
a unique target cash-to-permanent-income ratio will exist. Fourth, at the target cash
ratio, the expected growth rate of consumption is slightly less than the expected growth
rate of permanent (noncapital) income. Finally, the expected growth rate of consumption
is declining in the level of cash. The first four propositions are proven under general
assumptions about parameter values; the last is shown to hold if there are no transitory
shocks, but may fail in extreme cases if there are both transitory and permanent shocks.
Szeidl (2012) has shown that such an economy will be characterized by stable invariant
distributions for the consumption ratio, the wealth ratio, and other variables.2 Using
Szeidl’s result, the final section discusses conditions under which, even with a fixed
aggregate interest rate that differs from the time preference rate, an economy populated
by buffer stock consumers converges to a balanced growth equilibrium in which the
growth rate of consumption tends toward the (exogenous) growth rate of permanent
income.

2 Szeidl’s proof supplants the analysis in an earlier draft of this paper, which conjectured the result and provided
supportive simulation evidence.

2 The Problem
2.1 Setup
The consumer solves a standard optimization problem from the current period t until
the end of life at T :
" T −t
#
X
max Et
β n u(ct+n )
n=0

where
u(•) = •1−ρ /(1 − ρ)

(1)

is a constant relative risk aversion utility function with ρ > 1.3 , 4 The consumer’s
initial condition is defined by market resources mt (Deaton (1991)’s ‘cash-on-hand’)
and permanent noncapital income pt .
In the usual treatment, a dynamic budget constraint (DBC) incorporates several
different elements that determine next period’s m (given this period’s choices); but for
the detailed analysis here, it will be useful to disarticulate the steps so that individual
ingredients can be separately examined:
at = mt − ct
bt+1 = at R
pt+1 = pt Γψt+1
| {z }

(2)

≡Γt+1

mt+1 = bt+1 + pt+1 ξt+1 ,
where at indicates the consumer’s assets at the end of period t, which grow by a fixed
interest factor R = (1 + r) between periods,5 so that bt+1 is the consumer’s financial
(‘bank’) balances before next period’s consumption choice;6 mt+1 (‘market resources’ or
‘money’) is the sum of financial wealth bt+1 and noncapital income pt+1 ξt+1 (permanent
noncapital income pt+1 multiplied by a mean-one iid transitory income shock factor
ξt+1 ; future transitory shocks are assumed to satisfy Et [ξt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1). Permanent
noncapital income in period t + 1 is equal to its previous value, multiplied by a growth
factor Γ, modified by a mean-one iid shock ψt+1 , Et [ψt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1 satisfying

3 The main results also hold for logarithmic utility which is the limit as ρ → 1 but incorporating the logarithmic
special case in the proofs is cumbersome and therefore omitted.
4 We will define the infinite horizon solution as the limit of the finite horizon problem as the horizon T − t approaches
infinity.
5 See Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2018) for interesting new work that considers the case where capital returns are
stochastic and liquidity constraints exist. Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) examines implications of capital income risk
for the distribution of wealth.
6 Allowing a stochastic interest factor is straightforward but adds little insight.

ψ ∈ [ψ, ψ̄] for 0 < ψ ≤ 1 ≤ ψ̄ < ∞ (and ψ = ψ̄ = 1 is the degenerate case with no
permanent shocks).7 , 8
In future periods t + n ∀ n ≥ 1 there is a small probability ℘ that income will be zero
(a ‘zero-income event’),
(

with probability ℘ > 0
ξt+n =
(3)
θt+n /(1 − ℘) with probability (1 − ℘)

where θt+n is an iid mean-one random variable (Et [θt+n ] = 1 ∀ n > 0) with a distribution
satisfying θ ∈ [θ, θ̄] where 0 < θ ≤ 1 ≤ θ̄ < ∞ (degenerately θ = θ̄ = 1).9 Call the
cumulative distribution functions Fψ and Fθ (where Fξ is derived trivially from (3) and
Fθ ). Permanent income and cash start out strictly positive, {pt , mt } ∈ (0, ∞), and as
usual the consumer cannot die in debt, so
cT ≤ mT .

(4)

The model looks more special than it is. In particular, the assumption of a positive
probability of zero-income events may seem objectionable. However, it is easy to show
that a model with a nonzero minimum value of ξ (motivated, for example, by the
existence of unemployment insurance) can be redefined by capitalizing the present discounted value of minimum income into current market assets,10 analytically transforming
that model back into the model analyzed here. Also, the assumption of a positive point
mass (as opposed to positive density) for the worst realization of the transitory shock is
inessential, but simplifies the proofs and is a powerful aid to intuition.11
This model differs from Bewley’s (1977) classic formulation in several ways. The
CRRA utility function does not satisfy Bewley’s assumption that u(0) is well defined, or
that u0 (0) is well defined and finite; indeed, neither the value function nor the marginal
value function will be bounded. It differs from Schectman and Escudero (1977) in that
they impose liquidity constraints and positive minimum income. It differs from both
of these in that it permits permanent growth in income, and also permanent shocks to
income, which a large empirical literature finds are quantitatively important in micro
data12 and which since Friedman (1957) have been understood to be far more consequential for household welfare than are transitory fluctuations. It differs from Deaton (1991)
because liquidity constraints are absent; there are separate transitory and permanent
shocks (a la Muth (1960)); and the transitory shocks here can occasionally cause income
7 It is useful to emphasize that permanent noncapital income as defined here differs from what Deaton (1992) calls
permanent income (which is often adopted in the macro literature). Deaton defines permanent income as the amount
that a perfect foresight consumer could spend while leaving total (human and nonhuman) wealth constant. Relatedly, we
refer to mt as ‘cash-on-hand’ or ‘market resources’ rather than as wealth to avoid any confusion for readers accustomed
to thinking of the discounted value of future noncapital income as a part of wealth. The ‘market resources’ terminology
is motivated by the model’s assumption that human wealth cannot be capitalized, an implication of anti-slavery laws.
8 Hereafter for brevity we occasionally drop time subscripts, e.g. E[ψ −ρ ] signifies E [ψ −ρ ].

to reach zero.13 Finally, it differs from models found in Stokey et. al. (1989) because
neither liquidity constraints nor bounds on utility or marginal utility are imposed.14 , 15
The incorporation of permanent shocks rules out application of the tools of Matkowski
and Nowak (2011), who followed and corrected an error in the fundamental work on
the local contraction mapping method developed in Rincón-Zapatero and RodríguezPalmero (2003). Martins-da Rocha and Vailakis (2010) provides a correction to RincónZapatero and Rodríguez-Palmero (2003), and provides conditions that are easier to
verify, but again only addresses the deterministic case.

2.2 The Problem Can Be Rewritten in Ratio Form
We establish a bit more notation by reviewing the standard result that in problems
of this class (CRRA utility, permanent shocks) the number of relevant state variables
can be reduced from two (m and p) to one (m = m/p). Generically defining nonbold
variables as the boldface counterpart normalized by pt (as with m), assume that value
in the last period of life is u(mT ), and consider the problem in the second-to-last period,
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = max u(cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(mT )]
cT −1

= max u(pT −1 cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(pT mT )]
cT −1


1−ρ
= pT −1 max u(cT −1 ) + β ET −1 [u(ΓT mT )] ,
cT −1

(5)

where the last line follows because for the CRRA utility function (1), u(xy) = x1−ρ u(y).
Now, in a one-time deviation from the notational convention established in the last
paragraph, define nonbold ‘normalized value’ not as vt /pt but as vt = vt /pt1−ρ , because
this allows us to exploit features of the related problem,

vt (mt ) = max u(ct ) + β Et [Γt+1

s.t.
at = mt − ct
bt+1 = (R/Γt+1 )at = Rt+1 at
mt+1 = bt+1 + ξt+1 ,

(6)

where Rt+1 ≡ (R/Γt+1 ) is a ‘growth-normalized’ return factor, and the new problem’s
first order condition is
−ρ −ρ
c−ρ
t = Rβ Et [Γt+1 ct+1 ].

13 Below

(7)

it will become clear that the Deaton model is a particular limit of this paper’s model.
restrictions to those in the cited literature are made in the well known papers by Scheinkman and Weiss (1986)
and Clarida (1987). See Toche (2005) for an elegant analysis of a related but simpler continuous-time model.
15 Alvarez and Stokey (1998) relaxed the bounds on the return function, but they address only the deterministic case.

Since vT (mT ) = u(mT ), defining vT −1 (mT −1 ) from (6), we obtain
vT −1 (mT −1 , pT −1 ) = pT1−ρ
−1 vT −1 (mT −1 /pT −1 ).
|
{z
}
=mT −1

This logic induces to all earlier periods, so that if we solve the normalized one-statevariable problem (6), we will have solutions to the original problem for any t < T from:
vt (mt , pt ) = pt1−ρ vt (mt ),
ct (mt , pt ) = pt ct (mt ).

2.3 Definition of a Nondegenerate Solution
We say that this problem has a nondegenerate solution if, as the number of remaining
periods of life gets arbitrarily large, the backward-iterating solution defines a unique
limiting consumption function c(•) that satisfies
(8)

0 < c(m) < ∞

for every 0 < m < ∞. (‘Degenerate’ limits will be cases where the limiting consumption
function is c(m) = 0 or c(m) = ∞.)

2.4 Perfect Foresight Benchmarks
The familiar analytical solution to the perfect foresight specialization of the model,
obtained by setting ℘ = 0 and θ = θ̄ = ψ = ψ̄ = 1, allows us to define some remaining
notation and terminology.
2.4.1 Human Wealth
The dynamic budget constraint, strictly positive marginal utility, and the can’t-die-indebt condition (4) imply an exactly-holding intertemporal budget constraint (IBC):
h

PDVt (c) = mt − pt + PDVt (p),

where b is nonhuman wealth and ht is ‘human wealth,’ and with a constant R ≡ R/Γ,

Finite Human Wealth Condition (‘FHWC’):
Γ/R < 1.
|{z}

≡R−1

7

(12)

Intuitively, for human wealth to be finite, the growth rate of (noncapital) income must
be smaller than the interest rate at which that income is being discounted.
2.4.2 Unconstrained Solution
The consumption Euler equation holds in every period; with u0 (c) = c−ρ ,
ct+1 /ct = (Rβ)1/ρ ≡ Þ

(13)

Þ < 1,

(14)

Þ R ≡ Þ /R

(15)

where the Old English letter ‘thorn’ represents what we will call the ‘absolute patience
factor’ (Rβ)1/ρ .16 The sense in which Þ captures patience is that if the ‘absolute
impatience condition’ (AIC) holds,
the consumer will choose to spend an amount too large to sustain indefinitely (the level
of consumption must fall over time). We call such a consumer ‘absolutely impatient’
(the key condition in Bewley (1977)).
We next define a ‘return patience factor’ that relates absolute patience to the return
factor:
and since consumption is growing by Þ but discounted by R:

(18)

where κt is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) because it answers the question
‘if the consumer had an extra unit of wealth, how much more would be spent.’ (The
overbar on c reflects the fact that this will be an upper bound as we modify the problem
to incorporate constraints and uncertainty; analogously, the underbar for κ indicates
that it is a lower bound). Equation (17) makes plain that for the limiting MPC to be
strictly positive as n = T − t goes to infinity we must impose the Return Impatience
16 Impatience conditions of one kind or another have figured in intertemporal optimization problems since such problems
were first formalized in economics, most notably by Ramsey (1928). Discussion of these issues was prominent in the
literature of the 1960s and 1970s, and no brief citations here could do justice to the literature on the topic, so I refrain
from the attempt.

Condition (RIC):
(19)

Þ R < 1,

so that

0 < κ ≡ 1 − Þ R = lim κT −n .

(20)

c̄(m) = (m + h − 1)κ,

(21)

vt = u(ct ) + βu(ctÞ ) + β 2 u(ctÞ 2 ) + ...

(22)

n→∞

The RIC thus imposes a second kind of ‘impatience:’ The consumer cannot be so
pathologically patient as to wish, in the limit as the horizon approaches infinity, to
spend nothing today out of an increase in current wealth; that is, the condition rules
out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = 0. Because the return patience factor Þ R
is the absolute patience factor divided by the return, we call equation (19) the ‘return
impatience condition’ or RIC; we will say that a consumer who satisfies the condition is
‘return impatient.’
Given that the RIC holds, and defining limiting objects by the absence of a time
subscript (e.g., c̄(m) = limn↑∞ c̄T −n (m)), the limiting consumption function will be
and we now see that in order to rule out the degenerate limiting solution c̄(m) = ∞ we
need h to be finite; that is, we must impose the finite human wealth condition (12).
A final useful point is that since the perfect foresight growth factor for consumption
is Þ , u(xy) = x1−ρ u(y) yields an analytical expression for value:

Þ1−ρ < 1;17 with
which asymptotes to a finite number as n = T − t approaches +∞ if βÞ
a bit of algebra,18 this requirement can be shown to be equivalent to the RIC. Thus,
the same conditions that guarantee a nondegenerate limiting consumption function also
guarantee a nondegenerate limiting value function (which, interestingly, will not be true
when we incorporate uncertainty).
2.4.3 Constrained Solution
If a liquidity constraint requiring b ≥ 0 is ever to be relevant, it must be relevant at
the lowest possible level of market resources, mt = 1, which obtains for a consumer who
enters period t with bt = 0. The constraint is ‘relevant’ if it prevents the choice that

would otherwise be optimal; at mt = 1 the constraint is relevant if the marginal utility
from spending all of today’s resources ct = mt = 1, exceeds the marginal utility from
doing the same thing next period, ct+1 = 1; that is, if such choices would violate the
Euler equation (7):
1−ρ > Rβ(Γ)−ρ 1−ρ .

(23)

By analogy to the return patience factor, we therefore define a ‘perfect foresight growth
patience factor’ (PF-GPF) as
Þ Γ = Þ /Γ,

(24)

ÞΓ < 1

(25)

and define a ‘perfect foresight growth impatience condition’ (PF-GIC)
which is equivalent to (23) (exponentiate both sides by 1/ρ).
If the RIC (19) and the FHWC (12) hold, appendix A shows that, for some 0 < m# <
1, an unconstrained consumer behaving according to (21) would choose c < m for all
m > m# . In this case the solution to the constrained consumer’s problem is simple:
For any m ≥ m# the constraint does not bind (and will never bind in the future)
so the constrained consumption function is identical to the unconstrained one. If the
consumer were somehow19 to arrive at an m < m# < 1 the constraint would bind and
the consumer would have to consume c = m. The ◦ accent will designate the limiting
constrained consumption function:
(
m
if m < m#
c̊(m) =
(26)
c̄(m) if m ≥ m# .

More useful is the case where the perfect foresight growth and return impatience
conditions both hold. In this case appendix A shows that the limiting constrained
consumption function is piecewise linear, with c̊(m) = m up to a first ‘kink point’ at
m1# > 1, and with discrete declines in the MPC at a set of kink points {m1# , m2# , ...}.
As m ↑ ∞ the constrained consumption function c̊(m) becomes arbitrarily close to the
κ(m) ≡ c̊0 (m)
unconstrained c̄(m), and the marginal propensity to consume function κ̊
limits to κ. Similarly, the value function v̊(m) is nondegenerate and limits into the
value function of the unconstrained consumer. This logic holds even when the finite

amount of resources bt > 1 will, over time, run those resources down so that by some
finite number of periods n in the future the consumer will reach bt+n = 0, and thereafter
will set c = m = 1 for eternity, a policy that will (using (22)) yield value of

The consumer’s value function is therefore nondegenerate.
The most peculiar possibility occurs when the RIC fails. Under these circumstances
the FHWC must also fail (Appendix A), and the constrained consumption function
is nondegenerate. (See appendix Figure 8 for a numerical example). While it is true

We now turn to the case with uncertainty. The model without constraints but with
uncertainty will turn out to be a close parallel to the model with constraints but without
uncertainty.

2.5 Uncertainty-Modified Conditions
2.5.1 Impatience
When uncertainty is introduced, the expectation of bt+1 can be rewritten as:
−1
Et [bt+1 ] = at Et [Rt+1 ] = at R Et [ψt+1
]

(28)

where Jensen’s inequality guarantees that the expectation of the inverse of the permanent
shock is strictly greater than one. It will be convenient to define the object
ψ ≡ (E[ψ −1 ])−1

because this permits us to write expressions like the RHS of (28) compactly as, e.g.,
at R/ψ −1 .20 We refer to this as the ‘compensated return,’ because it compensates (in a
risk-neutral way) for the effect of uncertainty on the expected growth-normalized return
(in the sense implicitly defined in (28)).
We can now transparently generalize the PF-GIC (25) by defining a ‘compensated
growth factor’
Γ = Γψ

(29)

and a compensated Growth Patience Pactor (GPF):
Þ Γ = Þ /Γ
 
Þ
=E
Γψ

(30)

and a straightforward derivation ((44) below) yields the conclusion that
lim Et [mt+1 /mt ] = Þ Γ ,

mt →∞

20 One way to think of ψ is as a particular kind of a ‘certainty equivalent’ of the shock; this captures the intuition that
mean-one shock renders a given mean level of income less valuable than if the shock did not exist, so that ψ < 1.

12

which implies that if we wish to prevent m from heading to infinity (that is, if we want
m to be expected to fall for some large enough value of m) we must impose a generalized
version of the Perfect Foresight Growth Impatience Condition (25); we call the ‘growth
impatience condition’ (GIC) the requirement that the Growth Patience Factor must be
less than 1:21
(31)

ÞΓ < 1

which is stronger than the perfect foresight version (25) because Γ < Γ (Jensen’s
inequality implies that ψ < 1 for nondegenerate ψ).
2.5.2 Autarky Value
Analogously to (22), a consumer who spent exactly their permanent income every period
would have value determined by the product of the expectation of the (independent)
future shocks to permanent income:


vt = Et u(pt ) + βu(pt Γt+1 ) + ... + β T −t u(pt Γt+1 ...ΓT )

T −t
Et [Γ1−ρ



1 − (βΓ1−ρ E[ψ 1−ρ ])T −t+1
= u(pt )
1 − βΓ1−ρ E[ψ 1−ρ ]

which invites the definition of a utility-compensated equivalent of the permanent shock,
ψ = (E[ψ 1−ρ ])1/(1−ρ)

which will satisfy ψ < 1 for ρ > 1 and nondegenerate ψ (and ψ < ψ for the reasonable
(though not required) case of ρ > 2); defining
(32)

Γ = Γψ
we can see that vt will be finite as T approaches ∞ if

z }| {
βΓ1−ρ < 1

(33)

β < Γρ−1
which we call the ‘finite value of autarky’ condition (FVAC) because it guarantees that
value is finite for a consumer who always consumes their (now stochastic) permanent
income. For nondegenerate ψ, this condition is stronger (harder to satisfy in the sense
of requiring lower β) than the perfect foresight version (27) because Γ < Γ.22
21 Equation

(31) is a bit easier to satisfy than the similar condition imposed by Deaton (1991):
to guarantee that his problem defined a contraction mapping.

2.6 The Baseline Numerical Solution
Figure 2 depicts the successive consumption rules that apply in the last period of
life (cT (m)), the second-to-last period, and various earlier periods under the baseline
parameter values listed in Table 2. (The 45 degree line is labelled as cT (m) = m because
in the last period of life it is optimal to spend all remaining resources.)
In the figure, the consumption rules appear to converge as the horizon recedes. Our
next purpose is to show that this appearance is not deceptive; we call the hypothesized
limiting infinite-horizon consumption rule
c(m) ≡ lim cT −n (m).
n→∞

(34)

2.7 Concave Consumption Function Characteristics
A precondition for the main proof is that the maximization problem (6) defines a
sequence of continuously differentiable strictly increasing strictly concave23 functions
{cT , cT −1 , ...}.24 The straightforward but tedious proof is relegated to appendix B. For
present purposes, the most important point is the following intuition: ct (m) < m for
all periods t < T because a consumer who spent all available resources would arrive in
period t + 1 with balances bt+1 of zero, and then might earn zero noncapital income over
the remaining horizon (an unbroken series of zero-income events is unlikely but possible).
In such a case, the budget constraint and the can’t-die-in-debt condition mean that the
consumer would be forced to spend zero, incurring negative infinite utility. To avoid

where the last equation is the same as the PF-FVAC condition except that the RHS is multiplied by ψ 1−1/ρ which is
strictly less than 1.
23 There is one obvious exception: c (m) is a linear (and so only weakly concave) function.

this disaster, the consumer never spends everything. (This is an example of the ‘natural
borrowing constraint’ induced by a precautionary motive, per Zeldes (1989)).25

2.8 Bounds for the Consumption Functions
The consumption functions depicted in Figure 2 appear to have limiting slopes as m ↓ 0
and as m ↑ ∞. This section confirms that impression and derives those slopes, which
also turn out to be useful in the contraction mapping proof.26 , 27
Assume (as discussed above) that a continuously differentiable concave consumption
function exists in period t + 1, with an origin at ct+1 (0) = 0, a minimal MPC κt+1 > 0,
and maximal MPC κ̄t+1 ≤ 1. (If t + 1 = T these will be κT = κ̄T = 1; for earlier periods
they will exist by recursion from the following arguments.)
The MPC bound as wealth approaches infinity is easy to understand: In this case, under our imposed assumption that human wealth is finite, the proportion of consumption
that will be financed out of human wealth approaches zero. The consequence is that
the proportional difference between the solution to the model with uncertainty and the
perfect foresight model shrinks to zero.
In the course of proving this, appendix F provides a useful recursive expression for
the (inverse of the) limiting MPC:
−1
κ−1
t = 1 + Þ R κt+1 .

(35)

2.8.1 Weak RIC Conditions
There is a parallel expression for the limiting maximal MPC as m ↓ 0: appendix equation
(96) shows that, as mt ↑ ∞,

(37)

a condition that we dub the ‘Weak Return Impatience Condition’ (WRIC) because with
ÞR < 1).
℘ < 1 it will hold more easily (for a larger set of parameter values) than the RIC (Þ
The essence of the argument is that as wealth approaches zero, the overriding consideration that limits consumption is the (recursive) fear of the zero-income events.

25 It would perhaps be better to call it the ‘utility-induced borrowing constraint’ as it follows from the assumptions on
the utility function (in particular, limc↓0 u(c) = −∞); for example, no such constraint arises if utility is of the (implausible)
Constant Absolute Risk Aversion form.
26 Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) show that the consumption function becomes linear as wealth approaches infinity
in a model with capital income risk and liquidity constraints; their results should generalize to the limits derived here if
capital income risk were added to the model.
27 Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2020) establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general income fluctuation
problem with capital income risk in a Markovian setting and use such a model to study the tail behavior of wealth in the
presence of risky returns to capital.

17

(That consideration is why the probability of the zero income event ℘ appears in the
expression.)
We are now in position to observe that the optimal consumption function must satisfy
κt mt ≤ct (mt ) ≤ κ̄t mt

(38)

because consumption starts at zero and is continuously differentiable (as argued above),
is strictly concave (Carroll and Kimball (1996)), and always exhibits a slope between κt
and κ̄t (the formal proof is provided in appendix D).
These limits are useful at least in the sense that they can be hard-wired into a solution
algorithm for the model, which has the potential to make the solution more efficient (cf.
Carroll, Chipeniuk, Tokuoka, and Wu (2020)). Alternatively, they can provide a useful
check on the accuracy of a solution algorithm that does not impose them directly.

2.9 Conditions Under Which the Problem Defines a Contraction Mapping
To prove that the consumption rules converge, we need to show that the problem defines
a contraction mapping. This cannot be proven using the standard theorems in, say,
Stokey et. al. (1989), which require marginal utility to be bounded over the space of
possible values of m, because the possibility (however unlikely) of an unbroken string
of zero-income events for the remainder of life means that as m approaches zero c must
approach zero (see the discussion in 2.7); thus, marginal utility is unbounded. Although a
recent literature examines the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Bellman equations
in the presence of ‘unbounded returns’ (see, e.g., Matkowski and Nowak (2011)), the
techniques in that literature cannot be used to solve the problem here because the
required conditions are violated by a problem that involves permanent shocks.28
Fortunately, Boyd (1990) provided a weighted contraction mapping theorem that
Alvarez and Stokey (1998) showed could be used to address the homogeneous case (of
which CRRA formulation is an example) in a deterministic framework; later, Durán
(2003) showed how to extend the Boyd (1990) approach to the stochastic case.
Definition 1. Consider any function • ∈ C(A, B) where C(A, B) is the space of continuous functions from A to B. Suppose z ∈ C(A, B) with B ⊆ R and z > 0. Then • is
z-bounded if the z-norm of •,


| • (m)|
,
(39)
k • kz = sup
z(m)
m
is finite.
For Cz (A, B) defined as the set of functions in C(A, B) that are z-bounded; w, x, y,
and z as examples of z-bounded functions; and using 0(m) = 0 to indicate the function
that returns zero for any argument, Boyd (1990) proves the following.

28 See Yao (2012) for a detailed discussion of the reasons the existing literature up through Matkowski and Nowak
(2011) cannot handle the problem described here.

such that 29 , 30
(1)T is non-decreasing, i.e. x ≤ y ⇒ {Tx} ≤ {Ty}
(2){T0} ∈ Cz (A, B)
(3)There exists some real 0 < α < 1, such that
{T(w + ζz)} ≤ {Tw} + ζαz holds for all real ζ > 0 .
Then T defines a contraction with a unique fixed point.
For our problem, take A as R>0 and B as R, and define


{Ez}(at ) = Et Γt+1

Using this, we introduce the mapping T : Cz (A, B) → C (A, B),31
{Tz}(mt ) =

max

ct ∈[κmt ,κ̄mt ]

u(ct ) + β ({Ez}(mt − ct )) .

(40)

We can show that our operator T satisfies the conditions that Boyd requires of
his operator T, if we impose two restrictions on parameter values. The first is the
WRIC necessary for convergence of the maximal MPC, equation (37) above. A more
serious restriction is the utility-compensated Finite Value of Autarky condition, equation
(33). (We discuss the interpretation of these restrictions in detail in section 2.11 below.)
Imposing these restrictions, we are now in position to state the central theorem of the
paper.
Theorem 1. T is a contraction mapping if the restrictions on parameter values (37)
and (33) are true (that is, if the weak return impatience condition and the finite value
of autarky condition hold).
Intuitively, Boyd’s theorem shows that if you can find a z that is everywhere finite
but goes to infinity ‘as fast or faster’ than the function you are normalizing with z,
the normalized problem defines a contraction mapping. The intuition for the FVAC
condition is just that, with an infinite horizon, with any initial amount of bank balances
b0 , in the limit your value can always be made greater than you would get by consuming
exactly your permanent income every period (say, by consuming (r/R)b0 −  for some
small  > 0).
The details of the proof are cumbersome, and are therefore relegated to appendix D.
Given that the value function converges, appendix D.3 shows that the consumption
functions converge.

29 We

will usually denote the function that results from the mapping as, e.g., {Tw}.
non-theorists, this notation may be slightly confusing; the inequality relations in (1) and (3) are taken to mean
‘for any specific element • in the domain of the functions in question’ so that, e.g., x ≤ y is short for x(•) ≤ y(•) ∀ • ∈ A.
In this notation, ζαz in (3) is a function which can be applied to any argument • (because z is a function).
31 Note that the existence of the maximum is assured by the continuity of {Ez}(a ) (it is continuous because it is the
t
sum of continuous z-bounded functions z) and the compactness of [κmt , κ̄mt ].

2.10 The Liquidity Constrained Solution as a Limit
This section shows that a related problem commonly considered in the literature (e.g.,
with a simpler income process, by Deaton (1991)), with a liquidity constraint and a
positive minimum value of income, is the limit of the problem considered here as the
probability ℘ of the zero-income event approaches zero.
The essence of the argument is easy to state. As noted above, the possibility of earning
zero income over the remainder of the horizon prevents the consumer from ending the
current period with zero assets because with some finite probability the consumer would
be forced to consume zero, which would be infinitely painful.
But the extent to which the consumer feels the need to make this precautionary
provision depends on the probability that it will turn out to matter. As ℘ ↓ 0, that
probability becomes arbitrarily small, so the amount of precautionary saving approaches
zero. But zero precautionary saving is the amount of saving that a liquidity constrained
consumer with perfect foresight would choose.
Another way to understand this is just to think of the liquidity constraint as being
imposed by specifying a component of the utility function that is zero whenever the
consumer ends the period with (strictly) positive assets, but negative infinity if the
consumer ended the period with (weakly) negative assets.
See appendix G for the formal proof justifying the foregoing intuitive discussion.

2.11 Discussion of Parametric Restrictions
The full relationship among all the conditions articulated above is represented in Figure 3. Though the diagram looks complex, it is merely a modified version of the
earlier diagram with further (mostly intermediate) inequalities inserted. Again readers
unfamiliar with such diagrams should Appendix ) for a more detailed explanation.
2.11.1 The RIC
In the perfect foresight unconstrained problem (section 2.4.2), the RIC was required for
existence of a nondegenerate solution. It is surprising, therefore, that in the presence
of uncertainty, the RIC is neither necessary nor sufficient for a nondegenerate solution.
We thus begin our discussion by asking what features the problem must exhibit (given
the FVAC) if the RIC fails (that is, R < (Rβ)1/ρ ):

but since ψ < 1 and 0 < 1 − 1/ρ < 1 (because we have assumed ρ > 1), equation (41)
this can hold only if R/Γ < 1; that is, given the FVAC, the RIC can fail only if human
wealth is unbounded. Unbounded human wealth is permitted here, as in the perfect


foresight liquidity constrained problem. But, from equation (35), an implication of 
RIC
0
is that limm↑∞ c (m) = 0. Thus, interestingly, the presence of uncertainty both permits
unlimited human wealth and at the same time prevents that unlimited wealth from
resulting in infinite consumption. That is, in the presence of uncertainty, pathological
patience (which in the perfect foresight model with finite wealth results in consumption
of zero) plus infinite human wealth (which the perfect foresight model rules out because
it leads to infinite consumption) combine here to yield a unique finite limiting MPC for
any finite value of m. Note the close parallel to the conclusion in the perfect foresight
 case (for detailed analysis of this case

liquidity constrained model in the {PF-GIC,
RIC}
see appendix A). There, too, the tension between infinite human wealth and pathological
patience was resolved with a nondegenerate consumption function whose limiting MPC
was zero.
2.11.2 The WRIC
The ‘weakness’ of the additional requirement for contraction, the weak RIC, can be
seen by asking ‘under what circumstances would the FVAC hold but the WRIC fail?’
Algebraically, the requirement is
βΓ1−ρ ψ 1−ρ < 1 < (℘β)1/ρ /R1−1/ρ .

(42)

If there were no conceivable parameter values that could satisfy both of these inequal-

21

ities, the WRIC would have no force. And if we require R ≥ 1, the WRIC is indeed
redundant because now β < 1 < Rρ−1 , so that the RIC (and WRIC) must hold.
But neither theory nor evidence demands that we assume R ≥ 1. We can therefore
approach the question of the WRIC’s relevance by asking just how low R must be for the
condition to be relevant. Suppose for illustration that ρ = 2, ψ 1−ρ = 1.01, Γ1−ρ = 1.01−1
and ℘ = 0.10. In that case (42) reduces to
β < 1 < (0.1β/R)1/2
but since β < 1 by assumption, the binding requirement is that
R < β/10
so that for example if β = 0.96 we would need R < 0.096 (that is, a perpetual riskfree
rate of return of worse than -90 percent a year) in order for the WRIC to bind. The
relevance of the WRIC is indeed “Weak.”
Perhaps the best way of thinking about this is to note that the space of parameter
values for which the WRIC is relevant shrinks out of existence as ℘ → 0, which section
2.10 showed was the precise limiting condition under which behavior becomes arbitrarily
close to the liquidity constrained solution (in the absence of other risks). On the other
hand, when ℘ = 1, the consumer has no noncapital income (so that the FHWC holds)
and with ℘ = 1 the WRIC is identical to the RIC; but the RIC is the only condition
required for a solution to exist for a perfect foresight consumer with no noncapital
income. Thus the WRIC forms a sort of ‘bridge’ between the liquidity constrained and
the unconstrained problems as ℘ moves from 0 to 1.
2.11.3 When the GIC Fails
If both the GIC and the RIC hold, the arguments above establish that the limiting
consumption function asymptotes to the consumption function for the perfect foresight
unconstrained function. The more interesting case is where the GIC fails. A solution
 is depicted in Figure 4. The consumption

that satisfies the combination FVAC and 
GIC
function is shown along with the Et [∆mt+1 ] = 0 locus that identifies the ‘sustainable’
level of spending at which m is expected to remain unchanged. The diagram suggests a
fact that is confirmed by deeper analysis: Under the depicted configuration of parameter
values (see the code for details), the consumption function never reaches the Et [∆mt+1 ] =
0 locus; indeed, when the RIC holds but the GIC does not, the consumption function’s
limiting slope (1 − Þ /R) is shallower than that of the sustainable consumption locus
(1 − Γ/R),32 so the gap between the two actually increases with m in the limit. Although
a nondegenerate consumption function exists, a target level of m does not (or, rather, the
target is m = ∞), because no matter how wealthy a consumer becomes, the consumer
will always spend less than the amount that would keep m stable (in expectation).
Tables 3 and 4 present a summary of the connections between the various conditions
in the presence and the absence of uncertainty.
32 This

is because Et [mt+1 ] = Et [Rt+1 (mt − ct )] + 1; solve m = (m − c)Rψ −1 + 1 for c and differentiate.

3 Analysis of the Converged Consumption Function
Figures 5 and 6a,b capture the main properties of the converged consumption rule when
the RIC, GIC, and FHWC all hold.33 Figure 5 shows the expected consumption growth
factor Et [ct+1 /ct ] for a consumer behaving according to the converged consumption rule,
while Figures 6a,b illustrate theoretical bounds for the consumption function and the
marginal propensity to consume.
Five features of behavior are captured, or suggested, by the figures. First, as mt ↑ ∞
the expected consumption growth factor goes to Þ , indicated by the lower bound in
Figure 5, and the marginal propensity to consume approaches κ = (1 − Þ R ) (Figure 6),
the same as the perfect foresight MPC.34 Second, as mt ↓ 0 the consumption growth
factor approaches ∞ (Figure 5) and the MPC approaches κ̄ = (1 − ℘1/ρÞ R ) (Figure 6).
Third (Figure 5), there is a target cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ such that if mt = m̌
then Et [mt+1 ] = mt , and (as indicated by the arrows of motion on the Et [ct+1 /ct ] curve),
the model’s dynamics are ‘stable’ around the target in the sense that if mt < m̌ then
cash-on-hand will rise (in expectation), while if mt > m̌, it will fall (in expectation).
Fourth (Figure 5), at the target m, the expected rate of growth of consumption is
slightly less than the expected growth rate of permanent noncapital income. The final
proposition suggested by Figure 5 is that the expected consumption growth factor is
declining in the level of the cash-on-hand ratio mt . This turns out to be true in the
absence of permanent shocks, but in extreme cases it can be false if permanent shocks
are present.35

3.1 Limits as mt ↑ ∞
Define

c(m) = κm
which is the solution to an infinite-horizon problem with no noncapital income (ξt+n =
0 ∀ n ≥ 1); clearly c(m) < c(m), since allowing the possibility of future noncapital
income cannot reduce current consumption.36
Assuming the FHWC holds, the infinite horizon perfect foresight solution (21) constitutes an upper bound on consumption in the presence of uncertainty, since Carroll and
Kimball (1996) show that the introduction of uncertainty strictly decreases the level of
consumption at any m.

33 These

figures reflect the converged rule corresponding to the parameter values indicated in Table 2.
the RIC fails, the limiting minimal MPC is 0; see appendix.
35 Throughout the remaining analysis I make a final assumption that is not strictly justified by the foregoing. We have
seen that the finite-horizon consumption functions cT −n (m) are twice continuously differentiable and strictly concave,
and that they converge to a continuous function c(m). It does not strictly follow that the limiting function c(m) is twice
continuously differentiable, but I will assume that it is.
36 We will assume the RIC holds here and subsequently so that κ > 0; the situation is a bit more complex when the
RIC does not hold. In that case the bound on consumption is given by the spending that would be undertaken by a
consumer who faced binding liquidity constraints. Detailed analysis of this special case is not sufficiently interesting to
warrant inclusion in the paper.

This argument applies equally well to the problem of the restrained consumer, because
as m approaches infinity the constraint becomes irrelevant (assuming the FHWC holds).

3.2 Limits as mt ↓ 0

Now consider the limits of behavior as mt gets arbitrarily small.
Equation (36) shows that the limiting value of κ̄ is
κ̄ = 1 − R−1 (℘Rβ)1/ρ .

Defining e(m) = c(m)/m as before we have

lim e(m) = (1 − ℘1/ρÞ R ) = κ̄.

L’Hôpital’s rule, we have
lim c0 (m) = lim e(m) = κ̄.

3.3 There Exists Exactly One Target Cash-on-Hand Ratio, which is Stable
We now prove the existence of a target cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ towards which
an agent’s m expects to move. (The ∨ accent is meant to invoke the fact that this is the
value that other m’s ‘point to.’) We state the necessary conditions for the existence of
m̌ and its properties in the following theorem.

38 The

same arguments establish limm↓0 Et [ct+1 /ct ] = ∞ for the problem of the restrained consumer.

28

Theorem 2. For the problem defined in section 2.1, if the GIC (31), and WRIC (37)
hold, then there exists a unique cash-on-hand-to-income ratio m̌ > 0 such that
Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1 if mt = m̌.

(46)

Moreover, m̌ is stable in the sense that
∀mt ∈ (0, m̌), Et [mt+1 ] > mt
∀mt ∈ (m̌, ∞), Et [mt+1 ] < mt .

(47)

The elements of the proof are:
• Existence and continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ]
• Existence of a point where Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
• Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing
3.3.1 Existence and Continuity of Et [mt+1 /mt ].
The consumption function exists because we have imposed the conditions (the WRIC and
FVAC) that theorem 1 establishes are sufficient for its existence. (Indeed, Appendix C
shows that c(m) is not just continuous, but twice continuously differentiable.)
Section 2.7 shows that for all t, at−1 = mt−1 − ct−1 > 0. Since mt = at−1 Rt + yt , even
if yt takes on its minimum value of 0, at−1 Rt > 0, since both at−1 and Rt are strictly
positive under our foregoing assumptions. With mt > 0, the ratio Et [mt+1 /mt ] inherits
continuity (and, for that matter, continuous differentiability) from the consumption
function.
3.3.2 Existence of a point where Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1.
The logic in section 3.2 showing that limmt ↓0 Et [ct+1 /ct ] = ∞ transparently implies the
same proposition for mt : limmt ↓0 Et [mt+1 ] > 0 so the ratio is unbounded.
The limit as mt goes to infinity is

The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if Et [mt+1 /mt ] is continuous, and takes
on values above and below 1, there must be at least one point at which it is equal to
one.

29

3.3.3 Et [mt+1 ] − mt is monotonically decreasing.

Now define ζ (mt ) ≡ Et [mt+1 ] − mt and note that

ζ (mt ) < 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] < 1
ζ (mt ) = 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] = 1
ζ (mt ) > 0 ↔ Et [mt+1 /mt ] > 1,

(49)

so that ζ (m̌) = 0. Our goal is to prove that ζ (•) is strictly decreasing on (0, ∞) using

The foregoing arguments rely on the continuous differentiability of c(m), so the
arguments do not directly go through for the restrained consumer’s problem in which
the existence of liquidity constraints can lead to discrete changes in the slope c0 (m) at
particular values of m. But we can use the fact that the restrained model is the limit
of the baseline model as ℘ ↓ 0 to conclude that there is likely a unique target cash level
even in the restrained model.
If consumers are sufficiently impatient, the limiting target level in the restrained model
will be m̌ = Et [ξt+1 ] = 1. That is, if a consumer starting with m = 1 will save nothing,
a(1) = 0, then the target level of m in the restrained model will be 1; if a consumer
with m = 1 would choose to save something, then the target level of cash-on-hand will
be greater than the expected level of income.

3.4 Expected Consumption Growth at Target m Is Less than Expected
Permanent Income Growth
In Figure 5 the intersection of the target cash-on-hand ratio locus at m̌ with the
expected consumption growth curve lies below the intersection with the horizontal line
representing the growth rate of expected permanent income. This can be proven as
follows.

interesting sidenote is that (51) is a close cousin to the FHWC: instead of R/Γ < 1 we have (R/Γ)ψ < 1.

3.5 Expected Consumption Growth Is a Declining Function of mt (or Is
It?)
Figure 5 depicts the expected consumption growth factor as a strictly declining function
of the cash-on-hand ratio. To investigate this, define
Υ (mt ) ≡ Γt+1 c(Rt+1 a(mt ) + ξt+1 )/c(mt ) = ct+1 /ct

c0t+1

ctΥ0t+1 = c0t+1 a0t R − c0t Γt+1 ct+1 /ct

The two shocks cause two kinds of variation in mt+1 . Variations due to ξt+1 satisfy
the proposition, since a higher draw of ξ both reduces c−ρ−1
and reduces the marginal

negative correlation.)
The software archive associated with this paper presents an example in which this
perverse effect dominates. However, extreme assumptions were required (in particular,

4 The Aggregate and Idiosyncratic Relationship
Between Consumption Growth and Income Growth
This section examines the behavior of large collections of buffer-stock consumers with
identical parameter values. Such a collection can be thought of as either a subset of the
population within a single country (say, members of a given education or occupation
group), or as the whole population in a small open economy.40
We have assumed infinite horizons. In practice, aggregative (macroeconomic) models
of this kind usually incorporate mortality in some fashion. We omit mortality here
because its incorporation in standard ways does not modify any of the derivations; but
mortality can have important quantitative implications, which are discussed briefly in
Section 4.3
Formally, we assume a continuum of ex ante identical households on the unit interval,
with constant total mass normalized to one and indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], all behaving
according to the model specified above.41
Szeidl (2012) proves that such a population will be characterized by an invariant
distribution of m that induces invariant distributions for c and a; designate these F m ,
F a , and F c .42

40 We will continue to take the aggregate interest rate as exogenous and constant. It is also possible, and only slightly
more difficult, to solve for the steady-state of a closed-economy version of the model where the interest rate is endogenous.
41 One inconvenient aspect of the model as specified is that it does not exhibit a stationary distribution of idiosyncratic
permanent noncapital income; the longer the economy lasts, the wider is the distribution. This problem can be remedied
by assuming a constant probability of death, and replacing deceased households with newborns whose initial idiosyncratic
permanent income matches the mean idiosyncratic permanent income of the population. For a fully worked-out general
equilibrium version of such a model, see Carroll, Slacalek, and Tokuoka (2015).
42 Szeidl’s proof supplants simulation evidence of ergodicity that appeared in an earlier version of this paper.

33

4.1 Consumption and Income Growth at the Household Level
It is useful to define the operator M [•] which yields the mean value of its argument in
the population, as distinct from the expectations operator E [•] which represents beliefs
about the future.
An economist with a microeconomic dataset could calculate the average growth rate
of idiosyncratic consumption, and would find
M [∆ log ct+1 ] = M [log ct+1 pt+1 − log ct pt ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt + log ct+1 − log ct ]
= M [log pt+1 − log pt ] + M [log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2) + M[log ct+1 − log ct ]
= (γ − σψ2 /2)

where γ = log Γ and the last equality follows because the invariance of F c (see Szeidl
(2012)) means that M [log ct+n ] = M [log ct ].43
Thus, in a population that has reached its invariant distribution, the growth rate of
idiosyncratic log consumption matches the growth rate of idiosyncratic log permanent
income.

4.2 Growth Rates of Aggregate Income and Consumption
Attanasio and Weber (1995) point out that concavity of the consumption function (or
other nonlinearities) can imply that it is quantitatively important to distinguish between
the growth rate of average consumption and the average growth rate of consumption.44
We have just examined the average growth rate; we now examine the growth rate of the
average.
Using boldface capital letters for aggregate variables, the growth factor for aggregate
income is given by:
Yt+1 /Yt = M [ξt+1 Γψt+1 pt ] /M [pt ξt ]
=Γ
because of the independence assumptions we have made about ξ and ψ.
The growth factor for aggregate assets is:

43 Papers

in the simulation literature have observed an approximate equivalence between the average growth rates of
idiosyncratic consumption and permanent income, but formal proof was not possible until Szeidl’s proof of ergodicity.
44 Since we assume number of the households are normalized to 1, aggregate and average variables are identical.

where the second-to-last line follows from Szeidl (2012)’s proof the ergodicity of the
distributions of normalized variables for this problem, which implies that M[at+1 − at ] =
0.
Unfortunately, it is clear that the covariance term in the numerator, while generally
small, will not in general be zero. This is because the realization of the permanent shock
ψt+1 has a nonlinear effect on at+1 .
Matters are simpler if there are no permanent shocks; see Appendix E for a proof that
in that case the growth rate of assets (and other variables) does eventually converge to
the growth rate of aggregate permanent income.
One way of thinking about this problem is that it reflects the fact that, under our
assumptions, the p variable does not have an ergodic distribution; the distribution of
permanent income becomes forever wider and wider over time in this model.

4.3 Mortality and Redistribution
In practice most modelers incorporate a constant positive probability of death in their
models, following Blanchard (1985). Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2017) show
that for probabilities of death that exceed a threshold that depends on the size of the
permanent shocks, the distribution of permanent income has a finite variance. In such
cases, numerical results confirm the intuition that the growth rate of aggregate assets
ends up matching the growth rate of permanent income.
But the assumption of finite lifetimes requires us to specify what happens to the assets
of the dying consumers.
4.3.1 Blanchard Lives
Blanchard (1985)’s solution is to include an annuitization scheme in which estates
of the dying are redistributed to survivors in proportion to survivors’ wealth, giving
the recipients a higher effective rate of return. This treatment has several analytical
advantages, the most notable of which is that the effect of mortality on the time
preference factor is the exact inverse of its effect on the (effective) interest factor: If
the probability of remaining alive is ℵ, then assuming that no utility accrues after death
makes the effective discount factor β̂ = βℵ. But the enhancement to the rate of return

35

from the annuity scheme yields an effective interest rate of R̂/ℵ. In consequence, the
Þ is unchanged from its value in the infinite
effective patience factor in the new economy Þ̂
horizon model:
Þ ≡ (βℵR/ℵ)1/ρ = (Rβ)1/ρ ≡ Þ .
Þ̂

(56)

The only adjustments this requires to the analysis from prior parts of this paper are
therefore to those elements that involve a role for R distinct from its contribution to
Þ/(R/ℵ) < 1) will be somewhat easier to satisfy because
Þ . For example, the RIC (Þ
R/ℵ > R.
4.3.2 Modigliani Lives
Blanchard (1985)’s innovation was useful because the prevailing alternative, the Life
Cycle model of Modigliani (1966), was unwieldy and difficult to use with the available
computational technologies when Blanchard was writing. But the appeal of Blanchard’s
assumption is undermined by the empirical fact that in practice, little annuitization
actually occurs (Pashchenko (2013), Brown, Kling, Mullainathan, and Wrobel (2008)).
Further, aside from the insight it yields, the Blanchard model’s analytical solution is
of little use today; all serious modeling now incorporates uncertainty, constraints, and
other features that rule out analytical solutions anyway. Such frameworks can easily
handle alternative assumptions about the disposition of assets at death.
The simplest such models are those that follow Modigliani in assuming there is
no bequest motive; any wealth remaining at death occurs accidentally (this is not
implausible, given the robust finding that for the great majority of households, bequests
amount to less than 2 percent of lifetime earnings, Hendricks (2016)).
Some of that wealth will be absorbed by any estate tax that may exist; modelers
have made a variety of assumptions about how any residue is distributed. Here, we
consider the simplest choice, because it also represents something of a polar alternative
to Blanchard: We assume that there is a 100 percent estate tax and that the reveneues
from the estate tax are used to fund government expenditures that yield utility in a
form that is separable from utility from nondurable consumption – say, for public goods
(or, equivalently, the resources are thrown in the ocean). In that case, the estate-related
wealth effectively simply vanishes from the economy.
This approach alters the conditions under which the economy has a fixed target wealthto-income ratio. Effectively, the return on aggregate wealth is lower than the contingenton-survival return on wealth at the individual level. The condition under which an
aggregate target wealth-to-income ratio will exist then becomes an aggregate version of
the Growth Impatience Condtion (GIC-Agg):
ÞΓ < 1.
ℵÞ

(57)

Intuitively, the condition required to prohibit unbounded growth in the aggregate
wealth-to-income ratio is the condition that prevents the wealth-to-income ratio of
individual consumers from growing faster than the rate at which mortality diminishes
their collective wealth.

36

Section 2.11.3 showed that the individual’s problem can have a nondegenerate consumption rule for consumers who fail to satisfy the individual version of the GIC.
The GIC-Agg therefore provides a bound on preferences which can accommodate a
population in which individual consumers have no upper bound on target wealth, but
the aggregate economy will nevertheless settle down to an equilibrium aggregate wealthto-income ratio. Further analysis of these matters is beyond the scope of this paper, but
the above-mentioned work of Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2017) presents an
example of the application of this point (and the associated toolkit reports the results
not only of tests of the individual but also the aggregate versions of the GIC).

5 Conclusions
This paper provides theoretical foundations for many characteristics of buffer stock
saving models that have heretofore been observed in numerical solutions but not
proven. Perhaps the most important such proposition is the existence of a target
cash-to-permanent-income ratio toward which actual resources will move. The intuition
provided by the existence of such a target can be a powerful aid to understanding a
host of numerical results.
Another contribution is integration of the paper’s results with the open-source EconARK toolkit, which is used to generate all of the quantitative results of the paper, and
which integrally incorporates all of the analytical insights of the paper.

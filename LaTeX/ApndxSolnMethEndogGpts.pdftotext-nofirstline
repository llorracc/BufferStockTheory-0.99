The model is solved using an extension of the method of endogenous gridpoints (Carroll
(2006)): A grid of possible values of end-of-period assets ~a is defined, and at these points,
marginal end-of-period-t value is computed as the discounted next-period expected
marginal utility of consumption (which the Envelope theorem says matches expected
marginal value). The results are then used to identify the corresponding levels of
consumption at the beginning of the period:1
u0 (ct (~a)) = Rβ Et [u0 (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))]

−1/ρ
~ct ≡ ct (~a) = Rβ Et (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))−ρ
.

The dynamic budget constraint can then be used to generate the corresponding m’s:
m
~ t = ~a + ~ct .
An approximation to the consumption function could be constructed by linear interpolation between the {m,
~ ~c} points. But a vastly more accurate approximation can be
made (for a given number of gridpoints) if the interpolation is constructed so that it also
matches the marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints. Differentiating (1) with
respect to a (and dropping policy function arguments for simplicity) yields a marginal
propensity to have consumed ca at each gridpoint:
u00 (ct )cat = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Γt+1 cm
t+1 Rt+1 ]
00
m
= Rβ Et [u (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rct+1 ]
a
00
ct = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rcm
t+1 ]/u (ct )

(2)

and the marginal propensity to consume at the beginning of the period is obtained from
the marginal propensity to have consumed by noting that, if we define m(a) = c(a) − a,
c=m−a
c + 1 = ma
a

which, together with the chain rule ca = cm ma , yields the MPC from
cm (ca + 1) = ca
cm = ca /(1 + ca )
and we call the vector of MPC’s at the m
~ t gridpoints ~κt .

The software can also solve a version of the model with explicit liquidity constraints, where the
Envelope condition does not hold.

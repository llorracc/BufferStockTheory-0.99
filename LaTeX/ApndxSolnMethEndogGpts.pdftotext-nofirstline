The model is solved using an extension of the method of endogenous gridpoints (?): A
grid of possible values of end-of-period assets ~a is defined, and at these points, marginal
end-of-period-t value is computed as the discounted next-period expected marginal
utility of consumption (which the Envelope theorem says matches expected marginal
value). The results are then used to identify the corresponding levels of consumption at
the beginning of the period:1
u0 (ct (~a)) = Rβ Et [u0 (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))]

−1/ρ
~ct ≡ ct (~a) = Rβ Et (Γt+1 ct+1 (Rt+1~a + ξt+1 ))−ρ
.

The dynamic budget constraint can then be used to generate the corresponding m’s:
m
~ t = ~a + ~ct .
An approximation to the consumption function could be constructed by linear interpolation between the {m,
~ ~c} points. But a vastly more accurate approximation can be
made (for a given number of gridpoints) if the interpolation is constructed so that it also
matches the marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints. Differentiating (1) with
respect to a (and dropping policy function arguments for simplicity) yields a marginal
propensity to have consumed ca at each gridpoint:
u00 (ct )cat = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Γt+1 cm
t+1 Rt+1 ]
00
m
= Rβ Et [u (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rct+1 ]
a
00
ct = Rβ Et [u00 (Γt+1 ct+1 )Rcm
t+1 ]/u (ct )

and the marginal propensity to consume at the beginning of the period is obtained from
the marginal propensity to have consumed by noting that, if we define m(a) = c(a) − a,
c=m−a
c + 1 = ma
a

which, together with the chain rule ca = cm ma , yields the MPC from
cm (ca + 1) = ca
cm = ca /(1 + ca )
and we call the vector of MPC’s at the m
~ t gridpoints ~κt .

Envelope condition does not hold.

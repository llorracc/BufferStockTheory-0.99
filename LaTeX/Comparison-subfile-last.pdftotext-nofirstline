Finite Human Wealth
Γ/R < 1
The growth factor for permanent income
Γ must be smaller than the discounting
factor R for human wealth to be finite.

Uncertainty Versions
Condition (FHWC)
Γ/R < 1
The model’s risks are mean-preserving
spreads, so the PDV of future income is
unchanged by their introduction.

Absolute Impatience Condition (AIC)
Þ<1
Þ<1
If wealth is large enough, the expectation
The unconstrained consumer is
of consumption next period will be
sufficiently impatient that the level of
consumption will be declining over time: smaller than this period’s consumption:
ct+1 < ct

limmt →∞ Et [ct+1 ] < ct

Return Impatience Conditions
Return Impatience Condition (RIC)
Weak RIC (WRIC)
Þ /R < 1
℘1/ρÞ /R < 1
The growth factor for consumption Þ
If the probability of the zero-income

event is ℘ = 1 then income is always zero
factor R, so that the PDV of current and and the condition becomes identical to
future consumption will be finite:
the RIC. Otherwise, weaker.
c0 (m) = 1 − Þ /R < 1

c0 (m) < 1 − ℘1/ρÞ /R < 1

Growth Impatience Conditions
PF-GIC
Þ /Γ < 1
Guarantees that for an unconstrained
consumer, the ratio of consumption to
permanent income will fall over time. For
a constrained consumer, guarantees the
constraint will eventually be binding.

GIC
Þ E[ψ −1 ]/Γ < 1
By Jensen’s inequality, stronger than
the PF-GIC.
Ensures consumers will not
expect to accumulate m unboundedly.

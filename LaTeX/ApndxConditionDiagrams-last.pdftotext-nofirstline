1 Relational Diagrams for the Inequality Conditions
This appendix explains in detail the paper’s ‘inequalities’ diagrams (Figures 1,3).

1.1 The Unconstrained Perfect Foresight Model
A simple illustration is presented in Figure 1, whose three nodes represent values of
the absolute patience factor Þ , the permanent-income growth factor Γ, and the riskfree interest factor R. The arrows represent imposition of the labeled inequality condition (like, the uppermost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, reflects imposition of the
PF-GIC condition (clicking PF-GIC should take you to its definition at https://econark.github.io/BufferStockTheory#PFGIC; definitions of other conditions are also linked
below).1 Annotations inside parenthetical expressions containing ≡ have no content:
They are there to make the diagram readable for someone who may not immediately
remember terms and definitions from the main text. (Such a reader might also want to
be reminded that R, β, and Γ are all in R++ , and that ρ > 1).
Navigation of the diagram is simple: Start at any node, and deduce a chain of
inequalities by following any arrow that exits that node, and any arrows that exit from
successive nodes. Traversal must stop upon arrival at a node with no exiting arrows. So,
for example, we can start at the Þ node and impose the PF-GIC and then the FHWC,
and see that imposition of these conditions allows us to conclude that Þ < R.
One could also impose Þ < R directly (without imposing PF-GIC and FHWC) by
following the downward-sloping diagonal arrow exiting Þ . Although alternate routes
Þ < R, in this case),
from one node to another, all justify the same core conclusion (Þ

that the diagram is not commutative.3
Negation of a condition is indicated by the reversal of the corresponding arrow. For

deductions could be made. However, if we also reversed PF-GIC (that is, if we imposed

PF-GIC),
that would take us to the Þ node, and we could deduce R > Þ. However,
we would have to stop traversing the diagram at this point, because the arrow exiting
from the Þ node points back to our starting point, which (if valid) would lead us to the
conclusion that R > R. Thus, the reversal of the two earlier conditions (imposition of

Under these conventions, Figure 1 in the main text presents a modified version of
the diagram extended to incorporate the PF-FVAC (reproduced here for convenient
reference).
This diagram can be interpreted, for example, as saying that, starting at the Þ node,
it is possible to derive the PF-FVAC5 by imposing both the PF-GIC and the FHWC; or

The complexity of this algebraic calculation illustrates the usefulness of the diagram,
in which one merely needs to follow arrows to reach the same result.
After the warmup of constructing these conditions for the perfect foresight case, we
can represent the relationships between all the conditions in both the perfect foresight
case and the case with uncertainty as shown in Figure 3 in the paper (reproduced here).

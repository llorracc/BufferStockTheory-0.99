Arrows reflect the direction of the relationship; an arrowhead points to the larger of the two quantities
being compared. For example, the topmost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, indicates that Γ > Þ.

Figure 1.1 should be read as follows. The three nodes represent the values of the
absolute patience factor Þ, the growth factor for permanent income Γ, and the riskfree
interest factor R. The arrows between these quantities represent imposition of the labeled
condition. For example, the uppermost arrow, pointing from Þ to Γ, reflects imposition
of the PF-GIC condition. To make interpretation of the diagram easy, the mathematical
representation of the condition is expressed in parentheses as being equivalent (≡) to
the condition.
The imposition of the negation of the PF-GIC (the lower curved arrow pointing from Γ

PF-GIC)
could have been left out, under the convention that the negation
to Þ, labeled (
of an arrow pointing in one direction is an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. So,
 ≡ Þ > R but could be represented by moving

for example, the negation of the RIC is 

the arrowhead from the bottom right to the top left of the line segment connecting Þ
and R.
Because they reflect inequalities, the implications of the arrows accumulate as the

which illustrates another aspect of the diagram: If all arrows are reversed in a partial
traversal of the diagram leading to a final step, then the arrow for the final step must
also be reversed. In this case, since both conditions leading to R have had their arrows
reversed, the arrow coming out of R should also be reversed, implying the negation of
the RIC – as (1) proved.
For clarity, further diagrams will omit multiple arrows indicating reversal of causality

(in Figure 1.1 there would, for example, be only a single arrow, from Þ to Γ, at the top
level of the diagram). And definitions of conditions will also be omitted henceforth.
Under these conventions, as in the main text we can extend the diagram to incorporate
the PF-FVAC (see Figure 2).1

This diagram can be interpreted, for example, as saying that it is possible to derive
the PF-FVAC2 by imposing both the PF-GIC and the FHWC; or by imposing RIC and

For readers familiar with the commutative diagrams, it should be noted that this diagram is NOT
commutative, because the three ways of arriving at the conclusion embodied in the diagonal arrow (the
PF-FVAC) are NOT identical in their other implications.

After the warmup of constructing these conditions for the perfect foresight case, we
can represent the relationships between all the conditions in both the perfect foresight
case and the case with uncertainty as shown in Figure 11.

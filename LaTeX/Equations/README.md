# Equations

Some equations are useful not only in the main text, but in slide presentations,
tables, or elsewhere.

Such equations should be generated by some "single source of truth" so that changes
in notation or structure will flow automatically to all locations where the equations
are instantiated.

The SST should write the equation to this directory, where it will be accessible
to any other resources that may need it.

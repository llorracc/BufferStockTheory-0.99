For mt > 0 we can define et (mt ) = ct (mt )/mt and at (mt ) = mt − ct (mt ) and the

Consider the first conditional expectation in (1), recalling that if ξt+1 > 0 then
ξt+1 ≡ θt+1 /(1 − ℘). Since limm↓0 at (m) = 0, Et [(et+1 (mt+1 )mt+1 Γt+1 )−ρ | ξt+1 >
0] is contained within bounds defined by (et+1 (θ/(1 − ℘))Γψθ/(1 − ℘))−ρ and
(et+1 (θ̄/(1 − ℘))Γψ̄ θ̄/(1 − ℘))−ρ both of which are finite numbers, implying that
the whole term multiplied by (1 − ℘) goes to zero as mρt goes to zero. As mt ↓ 0
−ρ
the expectation in the other term goes to κ̄−ρ
t+1 (1 − κ̄t ) . (This follows from the
strict concavity and differentiability of the consumption function.) It follows that
1−ρ −ρ
the limiting κ̄t satisfies κ̄−ρ
κ̄t+1 (1 − κ̄t )−ρ . Exponentiating by ρ, we can
t = β℘R
conclude that
κ̄t = ℘−1/ρ (βR)−1/ρ R(1 − κ̄t )κ̄t+1

As noted in the main text, we need the WRIC (??) for this to be a convergent
sequence:
0 ≤ ℘1/ρÞ R < 1,

lim κ̄T −n = κ̄ ≡ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R

(6)

Since κ̄T = 1, iterating (4) backward to infinity (because we are interested in
the limiting consumption function) we obtain:
n→∞

and we will therefore call κ̄ the ‘limiting maximal MPC.’
The minimal MPC’s are obtained by considering the case where mt ↑ ∞. If the
FHWC holds, then as mt ↑ ∞ the proportion of current and future consumption

that will be financed out of capital approaches 1. Thus, the terms involving ξt+1
in (1) can be neglected, leading to a revised limiting Euler equation
h

(mt et (mt ))−ρ = βR Et (et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) (Rat (mt )))−ρ

and we know from L’Hôpital’s rule that limmt →∞ et (mt ) = κt , and limmt →∞ et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) =
κt+1 so a further limit of the Euler equation is
(mt κt )−ρ = βR (κt+1 R(1 − κt )mt )−ρ

and the same sequence of derivations used above yields the conclusion that if
the RIC 0 ≤ Þ R < 1 holds, then a recursive formula for the minimal marginal
propensity to consume is given by

so that {κ−1

as the limiting (inverse) marginal MPC. If the RIC does not hold, then
limn→∞ κ−1
T −n = ∞ and so the limiting MPC is κ = 0.
For the purpose of constructing the limiting perfect foresight consumption function, it is useful further to note that the PDV of consumption is given by

For mt > 0 we can define et (mt ) = ct (mt )/mt and at (mt ) = mt − ct (mt ) and the Euler

Consider the first conditional expectation in (1), recalling that if ξt+1 > 0 then
ξt+1 ≡ θt+1 /(1 − ℘). Since limm↓0 at (m) = 0, Et [(et+1 (mt+1 )mt+1 Γt+1 )−ρ | ξt+1 > 0]
is contained within bounds defined by (et+1 (θ/(1 − ℘))Γψθ/(1 − ℘))−ρ and
(et+1 (θ̄/(1 − ℘))Γψ̄ θ̄/(1 − ℘))−ρ both of which are finite numbers, implying that
the whole term multiplied by (1 − ℘) goes to zero as mρt goes to zero. As mt ↓ 0
−ρ
the expectation in the other term goes to κ̄−ρ
t+1 (1 − κ̄t ) . (This follows from the strict
concavity and differentiability of the consumption function.) It follows that the limiting
1−ρ −ρ
κ̄t satisfies κ̄−ρ
κ̄t+1 (1 − κ̄t )−ρ . Exponentiating by ρ, we can conclude that
t = β℘R
κ̄t = ℘−1/ρ (βR)−1/ρ R(1 − κ̄t )κ̄t+1

As noted in the main text, we need the WRIC (??) for this to be a convergent sequence:
0 ≤ ℘1/ρÞ R < 1,

(5)

lim κ̄T −n = κ̄ ≡ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R

(6)

Since κ̄T = 1, iterating (4) backward to infinity (because we are interested in the
limiting consumption function) we obtain:
n→∞

and we will therefore call κ̄ the ‘limiting maximal MPC.’
The minimal MPC’s are obtained by considering the case where mt ↑ ∞. If the
FHWC holds, then as mt ↑ ∞ the proportion of current and future consumption that
will be financed out of capital approaches 1. Thus, the terms involving ξt+1 in (1) can

be neglected, leading to a revised limiting Euler equation


(mt et (mt ))−ρ = βR Et (et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) (Rat (mt )))−ρ
and we know from L’Hôpital’s rule that limmt →∞ et (mt ) = κt , and limmt →∞ et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) =
κt+1 so a further limit of the Euler equation is
−ρ
(mt κt )−ρ = βR κt+1 R(1 − κt )mt

|R {zÞ} κt = (1 − κt )κt+1

and the same sequence of derivations used above yields the conclusion that if the RIC 0 ≤
Þ R < 1 holds, then a recursive formula for the minimal marginal propensity to consume
is given by

is also an increasing convergent sequence, and we define

as the limiting (inverse) marginal MPC. If the RIC does not hold, then limn→∞ κ−1
T −n =

For the purpose of constructing the limiting perfect foresight consumption function,
it is useful further to note that the PDV of consumption is given by

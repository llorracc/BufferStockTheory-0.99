# Data and Pseudo-Data

No data were harmed in the writing of this paper.

If any data _had_ been harmed, the raw source files for those data would
be in this directory.

This is also the place to put "pseudo-data": Data simulated by the model
whose characteristics should resemble the characteristics of the real data.

The code to process the data, and to generate "pseudo-data," should be somewhere
in the "Code" directory.

The combination of code and data should allow a reader to understand 
the torture techniques applied to make the data confess that the model
is right, as reflected in the remarkable similarity between the real data and pseudo-data.

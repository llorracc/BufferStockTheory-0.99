1 The Limiting MPC’s
For mt > 0 we can define et (mt ) = ct (mt )/mt and at (mt ) = mt − ct (mt ) and the Euler
equation (7) can be rewritten

Consider the first conditional expectation in (1), recalling that if ξt+1 > 0 then
ξt+1 ≡ θt+1 /(1 − ℘). Since limm↓0 at (m) = 0, Et [(et+1 (mt+1 )mt+1 Γt+1 )−ρ | ξt+1 > 0]
is contained within bounds defined by (et+1 (θ/(1 − ℘))Γψθ/(1 − ℘))−ρ and
(et+1 (θ̄/(1 − ℘))Γψ̄ θ̄/(1 − ℘))−ρ both of which are finite numbers, implying that
the whole term multiplied by (1 − ℘) goes to zero as mρt goes to zero. As mt ↓ 0
−ρ
the expectation in the other term goes to κ̄−ρ
t+1 (1 − κ̄t ) . (This follows from the strict
concavity and differentiability of the consumption function.) It follows that the limiting
1−ρ −ρ
κ̄t satisfies κ̄−ρ
κ̄t+1 (1 − κ̄t )−ρ . Exponentiating by ρ, we can conclude that
t = β℘R
κ̄t = ℘−1/ρ (βR)−1/ρ R(1 − κ̄t )κ̄t+1

which yields a useful recursive formula for the maximal marginal propensity to consume:

As noted in the main text, we need the WRIC (38) for this to be a convergent sequence:
0 ≤ ℘1/ρÞ R < 1,

(1)

lim κ̄T −n = κ̄ ≡ 1 − ℘1/ρÞ R

(2)

Since κ̄T = 1, iterating (1) backward to infinity (because we are interested in the
limiting consumption function) we obtain:
n→∞

and we will therefore call κ̄ the ‘limiting maximal MPC.’
The minimal MPC’s are obtained by considering the case where mt ↑ ∞. If the
FHWC holds, then as mt ↑ ∞ the proportion of current and future consumption that
will be financed out of capital approaches 1. Thus, the terms involving ξt+1 in (1) can

be neglected, leading to a revised limiting Euler equation


(mt et (mt ))−ρ = βR Et (et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) (Rat (mt )))−ρ
and we know from L’Hôpital’s rule that limmt →∞ et (mt ) = κt , and limmt →∞ et+1 (at (mt )Rt+1 ) =
κt+1 so a further limit of the Euler equation is
(mt κt )−ρ = βR (κt+1 R(1 − κt )mt )−ρ

and the same sequence of derivations used above yields the conclusion that if the RIC 0 ≤
Þ R < 1 holds, then a recursive formula for the minimal marginal propensity to consume
is given by

so that {κ−1

as the limiting (inverse) marginal MPC. If the RIC does not hold, then limn→∞ κ−1
T −n =
∞ and so the limiting MPC is κ = 0.
For the purpose of constructing the limiting perfect foresight consumption function,
it is useful further to note that the PDV of consumption is given by

ct 1 + Þ R + Þ 2R + ... = ct κ−1

which, combined with the intertemporal budget constraint, yields the usual formula for
the perfect foresight consumption function:
ct = (bt + ht )κt

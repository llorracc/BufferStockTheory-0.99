\section{Relational Diagrams for the Inequality Conditions}

This appendix explains in detail the paper's `inequalities' diagrams (\ref{fig:RelatePFGICFHWCRICPFFVAC},\ref{fig:Inequalities}).\footnote{Unless otherwise noted, the diagrams abide by the conventions that are used for constructing diagrams in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)}{category theory}.  In particular, the inequalities in the upper and lower triangular parts of the diagram indicate that this is not a commutative diagram.}  Our diagrams are inspired by, but should not be interpreted as implementing, the notation used in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)}{category theory diagrams}.  (For a popular introduction to category theory, see \cite{riehl2017category}).

\subsection{The Unconstrained Perfect Foresight Model}

A simple illustration of our method is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:InequalityPFGICFHWCRIC}, whose three nodes represent values of the absolute patience factor $\Pat$, the permanent-income growth factor $\PGro$, and the riskfree interest factor ${R}$.  The arrows represent imposition of the labeled inequality condition  (like,  the uppermost arrow, pointing from {$\Pat$} to $\PGro$, reflects imposition of the {\PFGIC} condition (clicking {\PFGIC} should take you to {\PFGICFull}; definitions of other conditions are also linked below).\footnote{For convenience, the equivalent ($\equiv$) mathematical statement of each condition is expressed nearby in parentheses.}  Annotations signified by parenthetical expressions containing $\equiv$ have no content: They are there to make the diagram readable for someone who may not immediately remember terms and definitions from the main text.  (Such a reader might also want to be reminded that ${R}, {\beta}, $ and $\Gamma$ are all in $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and ${\rho}>1$).

Navigation of the diagram is simple: Start at any node, and deduce a chain of inequalities by following any arrow that exits that node, and any arrows that exit from successive nodes.  Traversal must stop when it reaches a node with no exiting arrows.  So, for example, we can start at the $\Pat$ node and impose the {\PFGIC} and then the {\FHWC}, and conclude that imposition of these conditions allows us to conclude that $\Pat < {R}$.

Negation of a condition is indicated by the reversal of the corresponding arrow.  So, for example, the negation of the {\RIC},  $\cncl{\RIC} \equiv \Pat > {R}$, would be represented by moving the arrowhead from the bottom right to the top left of the line segment connecting {$\Pat$} and ${R}$.

If we were to start at ${R}$ and then impose $\cncl{\FHWC}$, that would reverse the arrow connecting ${R}$ and $\PGro$, but the $\PGro$ node would then have no exiting arrows so no further deductions could be made.  However, if we \textit{also} reversed $\PFGIC$ (that is, if we imposed $\cncl{\PFGIC}$), that would take us to the $\Pat$ node, and we could deduce ${R} > \Pat$.  However, we would have to stop traversing the diagram at this point, because the arrow exiting from the $\Pat$ node points back to our starting point, which (if valid) would lead us to the conclusion that ${R} > {R}$.  Thus, the reversal of the two earlier conditions (imposition of $\cncl{\FHWC}$ and $\cncl{\PFGIC}$) requires us also to reverse the final condition, giving us $\cncl{\RIC}$.  The corresponding algebra is
\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
  \cncl{\FHWC}:~~~~  {R} & < \PGro \notag  
  \\ \cncl{\PFGIC}:~~~~ \PGro & < \Pat %~\left(\equiv ({R} \DiscFac)^{1/{\rho}}\right)
                                \label{eq:cnclRIC}
  \\ \Rightarrow \cncl{\RIC}:~~~~{R} & < \Pat \notag,
\end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation}

% which illustrates another aspect of the diagram: If all arrows are reversed in a partial traversal of the diagram leading to a final step, then the arrow for the final step must also be reversed.  In this case, since both conditions leading to ${R}$ have had their arrows reversed, the arrow coming out of ${R}$ should also be reversed, implying the negation of the {\RIC} -- as \eqref{eq:cnclRIC} proved.

% For clarity, further diagrams will omit multiple arrows indicating reversal of causality (in Figure~\ref{fig:InequalityPFGICFHWCRIC} there would, for example, be only a single arrow, from {$\Pat$} to $\PGro$, at the top level of the diagram).  And definitions of conditions will also be omitted henceforth.

Under these conventions, the main text presents a version of the diagram extended to incorporate the {\PFFVAC} \href{https://econ-ark.github.io/BufferStockTheory/#RelatePFGICFHWCRICPFFVAC}{reproduced in Figure}~\ref{fig:RelatePFGICFHWCRICPFFVAC}).%\footnote{For readers familiar with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram}{commutative diagrams}, it should be noted that despite the similar appearance, this diagram is not exactly commutative.}%  because the three ways of arriving at the conclusion embodied in the diagonal arrow (the {\PFFVAC}) are NOT identical in their other implications.}

This diagram can be interpreted, for example, as saying  that, starting at the $\Pat$ node, it is possible to derive the $\PFFVAC$\footnote{in the form $\Pat < ({R}/\PGro)^{1/{\rho}}\PGro$} by imposing both the {\PFGIC} and the {\FHWC}; or by imposing {\RIC} and \cncl{\FHWC}.  Or, starting at the $\PGro$ node, we can follow the imposition of the {\FHWC} (twice - reversing the arrow labeled $\cncl{\FHWC}$) and then $\cncl{\RIC}$ to reach the conclusion that $\Pat < \PGro$.  Algebraically,
\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
  {\FHWC}:~~~ \PGro & < {R} 
  \\ \cncl{\RIC}:~~~ {R} & < \Pat 
  \\ \PGro & < \Pat \label{eq:cnclPFGIC}
\end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation}
which leads to the negation of both of the conditions leading into $\Pat$.  \cncl{\PFGIC} is obtained directly as the last line in \eqref{eq:cnclPFGIC} and \cncl{\PFFVAC} follows if we start by multipling the Return Patience Factor ({\RPF}=$\Pat/{R}$) by the \FHWF (=$\PGro/{R}$) raised to the power $1/{\rho}-1$, which is negative since we imposed ${\rho} > 1$.  {\FHWC} implies {\FHWF} $< 1$ so when {\FHWF} is raised to a negative power the result is greater than one.
Multiplying the {\RPF} (which exceeds 1 because \cncl{\RIC}) by another number greater than one yields a product that must be greater than one:
\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
  1  & < \overbrace{\left(\frac{({R} \DiscFac)^{1/{\rho}}}{{R}}\right)}^{>1 \text{~from~}\cncl{\RIC}}\overbrace{\left(\PGro/{R}\right)^{1/{\rho}-1}}^{\phantom{...}>1~\text{~from~} \FHWC} \notag
  \\ 1  & < \left(\frac{({R} \DiscFac)^{1/{\rho}}}{({R}/\PGro)^{1/{\rho}}{R}\PGro/{R}}\right) \label{eq:cnclFHWFAndcnclRICImplycnclPFFVAC}
  \\ {R}^{1/{\rho}}\PGro^{1 - 1/{\rho}} = ({R}/\PGro)^{1/{\rho}} \PGro  & < \Pat \notag
\end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation}
which is one way of writing $\cncl{\PFFVAC}$.

The complexity of this algebraic calculation illustrates the usefulness of the diagram, in which one merely needs to follow arrows to reach the same result.

After the warmup of constructing these conditions for the perfect foresight case, we can represent the relationships between all the conditions in both the perfect foresight case and the case with uncertainty as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Inequalities} in the paper (reproduced below).
